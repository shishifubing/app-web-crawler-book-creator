  <p class="noindent">First High clinched the overall victory before the final day and decided to postpone the celebration until tomorrow. (Again? Anyone who said this was promptly ignored.)</p>

  <p>Tomorrow, the finals for the Official Division’s Monolith Code, one of the most popular draws of the Nine Schools Competition, would commence.</p>

  <p>First High’s representatives advanced to the finals after taking first in the preliminary round. Neither the players nor the auxiliaries had the time to attend the party.</p>

  <p>However, since there was only one event remaining, it was also true that most of the members had plenty of time on their hands.</p>

  <p>As Miyuki powerfully contributed to First High’s overall victory with her performance in Mirage Bat, this time she was the center of the celebratory tea party held in the conference room.</p>

  <p>Mayumi and Suzune hosted the event, with the female players making up the majority of those in attendance. That being said, it’s not like there were no boys present. The uninjured Year 1 male students were congregated in a corner and holding their cups in a dejected manner. (The Year 2 and 3 male students were busy preparing for tomorrow’s contest.)</p>

  <p>Not only were Mikihiko and Leo present, Erika and Mizuki could be seen as well. Mayumi likely had another purpose in mind. (Erika tried her utmost to decline, but was forcibly conscripted by Miyuki.)</p>

  <p>Yet, for some reason, there was no trace of Tatsuya.</p>

  <p>“…So, he said not to wake him until morning?”</p>

  <p>“Yes.”</p>

  <p>“That’s no surprise.”</p>

  <p>“Since he’s been quite active lately…”</p>

  <p>As the Year 1 female students were in a group discussing a certain young man (they were Erika, Miyuki, Shizuku and Honoka), a Year 2 couple approached.</p>

  <p>“Hm? Your brother went to bed already?”</p>

  <p>It was Kanon and Isori.</p>

  <p>“Indeed, he said he was quite exhausted.”</p>

  <p>“That… would be true. And he’s injured as well.”</p>

  <p>Hearing Miyuki’s answer, Isori nodded deeply. Once he raised his eyes and looked towards Miyuki, his eyes slightly widened.</p>

  <p>“Hm? Isn’t this Erika?”</p>

  <p>“Kei-senpai, have you completed the calibrations for tomorrow?”</p>

  <p>“No, taking a breather… Though it’s more like Kanon dragged me out.”</p>

  <p>Isori could only smile wryly at these slightly mocking words. Next to him, Kanon wore a slightly irritated expression which was not completely caused by the earlier verbal exchange. There appeared to be something deeper as well.</p>

  <p>“…Ah, Erika knows Isori-senpai?”</p>

  <p>“Chalk it up to family relations.”</p>

  <p>Still, Erika didn’t hold Kanon’s mood against her, or more like intentionally pretended not to notice, as she turned to Miyuki.</p>

  <p>“The Chiba Family is greatly indebted to the Isori Family.”</p>

  <p>“That’s certainly not true!”</p>

  <p>“No need to be shy, that’s just how it is, objectively.”</p>

  <p>Seeing Isori frantically shake his head, Erika adopted a more teasing tone.</p>

  <p>“My CAD was also developed by the Isori Family. Speaking of which, didn’t Isori-senpai make it for me?”</p>

  <p>Speaking of which, Erika pulled out her CAD that was shaped like a retractable police baton out of nowhere.</p>

  <p>“Well, I guess… But only the ‘Engraving’ portion.”</p>

  <p>“You designed the Engraving spell yourself? That’s incredible…”</p>

  <p>“Kei is a genius!”</p>

  <p>When Mizuki expressed her sincere admiration, Kanon was so proud that she momentarily forgot her displeasure. Isori could only shyly murmur once more: “That’s definitely not true.”</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">By the time his absence had ceased to be a topic of conversation, Tatsuya slipped out of the hotel and advanced towards the parking garage reserved for officers on base. The other party was already there waiting for him.</p>

  <p>“How rude, to leave a woman waiting!”</p>

  <p>“My apologies.”</p>

  <p>This was hardly the time and place, but since he was in the wrong — less on the gender issue, more on his tardiness — Tatsuya frankly apologized when scolded.</p>

  <p>Maybe she was disappointed that Tatsuya didn’t offer any excuses, but Haruka didn’t complain as she gestured for Tatsuya to get in the car she was leaning against.</p>

  <p>After Tatsuya slid into the passenger seat, Haruka sat behind the wheel.</p>

  <p>Both the interior and exterior of the vehicle remained darkened.</p>

  <p>Haruka didn’t bother to glance at the ignition and directly pulled out a smartphone from the storing space on the door.</p>

  <p>Seeing this, Tatsuya also pulled out a terminal from his jacket pocket.</p>

  <p>This was not the uniform for the auxiliaries, but a pitch black jacket with two bulges beneath the armpits, which Haruka pretended to be oblivious to.</p>

  <p>“Just the map data is sufficient?”</p>

  <p>“If you have the list of members, can you pass those to me as well?”</p>

  <p>Haruka sighed. Tatsuya started sending data towards her terminal.</p>

  <p>Seeing the display, Haruka’s eyes widened in shock.</p>

  <p>“Is that not enough?”</p>

  <p>“No, that’s quite enough!”</p>

  <p>Haruka hid her expression and manipulated her own terminal.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya skimmed over the data sent to him and said.</p>

  <p>“Much obliged.”</p>

  <p>Just as Tatsuya slightly nodded and was about to press the button to open the car door,</p>

  <p>“This is insurance, isn’t it?”</p>

  <p>Haruka asked stiffly.</p>

  <p>“Indeed it is.”</p>

  <p>By the time this concise answer passed to Haruka’s ears, Tatsuya’s back was already facing her.</p>

  <p class="break">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent">As he watched Haruka drive the electric double-door sports car through the main exit, Tatsuya removed the gauze covering his right ear and headed towards another car. Before he could tap on the window, the car door on the passenger side automatically opened. Inside, a woman near Haruka’s age sat in the driver’s seat.</p>

  <p>“Who was that woman?”</p>

  <p>“Agent from Public Safety.”</p>

  <p>Tatsuya easily revealed Haruka’s identity and smirked at Fujibayashi.</p>

  <p>“Though she insists that her day job is that of a life counselor.”</p>

  <p>Fujibayashi burst into laughter.</p>

  <p>“So she’s a part-time agent.”</p>

  <p>“I think she’s fine on the ability end. Compared to seasoned veterans, rookies fresh out the door tend to be more reliable. They usually stick to confidentiality down to the letter, so I feel safer asking them for temp work. At any rate…… Accepting side jobs is slightly unethical, but money talks and merit walks — I guess that’s just how it is.”</p>

  <p>Hearing Tatsuya nonchalantly speak such bleak words, Fujibayashi squinted at him — her eyes remained calm.</p>

  <p>“Sometimes, why do I get the feeling that you should be 10 years older?”</p>

  <p>“I feel that this has nothing to do with age and everything to do with experience. After all, I’ve accumulated varied experiences of all sorts here and there.”</p>

  <p>Emphasis placed on the term varied. Hearing this, Fujibayashi casually averted her gaze from Tatsuya.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya didn’t anticipate any particularly special response.</p>

  <p>He removed the connection cable from the dashboard compartment and smoothly operated the touch screen on the passenger’s seat and transferred the map data he obtained from Haruka into the navigation system.</p>

  <p>“…I wonder if I can report this as overtime…”</p>

  <p>“I think this certainly qualifies.”</p>

  <p>“The labor laws hardly apply to people like us!”</p>

  <p>Despite elastic employment becoming mainstream, some laws still stubbornly survived the times. At being prompted to retread familiar territory, Fujibayashi didn’t even bother to force a smile and merely shot Tatsuya a look and shifted the stick forward.</p>

  <p>The commonly seen electric car employed by the masses shifted into silent run, a feature not detailed in the instruction manual, and slipped away in the darkness.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">Meanwhile, the one who ordered Fujibayashi into the field was entertaining an unexpected guest.</p>

  <p>“Please come in, sir.”</p>

  <p>The individual in question, who was not being welcomed by the soldiers on duty but by Kazama himself, was Elder Kudou.</p>

  <p>Back when the old man was in the service, the rule that the “Ten Master Clans shall not assume high roles in government” had not been established yet.</p>

  <p>That was because this rule was put into effect after experiencing a series of circumstances involving Kudou himself that ultimately led to the establishment of this rule.</p>

  <p>When he retired, Elder Kudou held the rank of major general. Kazama’s greeting was not out of respect for his status as an elder of the Ten Master Clans, but done in regards to his rank based on military protocol.</p>

  <p>Kazama was a B-ranked Magician and also a member of the magical community that had the Ten Master Clans at the pinnacle. That being said, he identified himself as a Magician using the Ancient Magic “Ninjutsu”, so he had a rather chilly relationship with the Ten Master Clans, who were the epitome of modern magic. (Naturally, his relationship with his subordinates within the battalion was another story altogether.)</p>

  <p>Thus — assuming this was the right way to put it — Kazama’s attitude might be respectful, but never surpassed the boundaries of being mere “formalities”.</p>

  <p>“You’re dismissed.”</p>

  <p>“Yes, sir!”</p>

  <p>Kazama ordered the soldiers on duty who brought the tea out of the room and redirected his gaze to Elder Kudou.</p>

  <p>“So what may I do for you today? Fujibayashi is in the field right now and not present.”</p>

  <p>“I certainly don’t believe that seeing my granddaughter requires going through her superiors… It’s nothing really, I hear that it’s rare for you to come from Tsuchiura, so I came to see you.”</p>

  <p>“I’m honored.”</p>

  <p>Seeing Kazama use the word honored but fail to express any respectful attitude, Kudou smiled wryly.</p>

  <p>“You still dislike the Ten Master Clans that much.”</p>

  <p>“I’ve said that was a misunderstanding.”</p>

  <p>“And I’ve said there’s no need to hide it. Magicians who wield Ancient Magic like you are ‘humans’ who have inherited the wisdom of the ages, unlike us, who are Magicians forged to be humanoid weapons. It’s perfectly understandable for there to be some resentment.”</p>

  <p>Kazama’s brows furrowed when he heard the word “human” being elongated on purpose.</p>

  <p>“…Turning ourselves into weapons is exactly the same thing the ancient Magicians did to themselves. There’s no great difference between you and I. If I do bear any resentment, that would be directed to humanity in general. I believe that this idea is something forced down the throats of children and the younger generation.”</p>

  <p>“Hm… So you took him in?”</p>

  <p>Kudou calmly rebutted Kazama’s fiery words.</p>

  <p>“…Him, as in?”</p>

  <p>“Shiba Tatsuya-kun. Isn’t he the son of Miya whom you acquired from the Yotsuba Family three years ago?”</p>

  <p>“………”</p>

  <p>Instead of being struck speechless, Kazama’s silence would be more aptly described as “highly irritated”.</p>

  <p>“It’s hardly surprising that I would know about it, right? Three years ago, I was conveniently the chairman of the committee for the Ten Master Clans and currently remain a magic advisor to national defense. Also, though it was for a short period of time, both Maya and Miya were my students.”</p>

  <p>“Then you should also know this. The Yotsuba Family has not relinquished their hold on Tatsuya. He remains a Yotsuba guardian. Only under the conditions that his role as a guardian is not compromised is Shiba Tatsuya allowed to participate in military missions. Besides guardian responsibilities, the Yotsuba Clan is not allowed to assert their precedence. That is the agreement we have with the Yotsuba Family.”</p>

  <p>“Don’t you feel that it’s a waste?”</p>

  <p>“What do you mean by a waste?”</p>

  <p>Seeing Kudou lean forward and ask in a conspiring manner, Kazama feigned ignorance as he replied.</p>

  <p>Elder Kudou did not fly into a rage and merely smirked.</p>

  <p>“Yesterday’s match was quite entertaining. While I hear that it was the only successful example, I didn’t imagine that it would be that powerful.”</p>

  <p>Retired Major General Kudou watched Major Kazama’s eyes like a hawk.</p>

  <p>“Sometime in the future, he will become our country’s invaluable military asset along with the scion of the Ichijou Family. Relegating such a superb individual to a mere private bodyguard, wouldn’t you consider that to be a waste?”</p>

  <p>“…Sir, do you wish to weaken the Yotsuba Family?”</p>

  <p>“Since it’s you, I’ll be blunt.”</p>

  <p>At Kazama’s question, Kudou maintained his thin smile and nodded.</p>

  <p>“Through a series of checks and balances, we prevent the possibility of Magicians losing control of themselves. This is written within the design behind the Ten Master Clans.”</p>

  <p>Kazama’s silence implied that, for him, Kudou’s words were all known facts.</p>

  <p>“However, at this current progression, the Yotsuba Family will become too powerful. At Shiba Tatsuya-kun and his sister’s current growth rate, in the near future, Maya will still be around, Shiba Miyuki will become Yotsuba Miyuki with Shiba Tatsuya continuing as her guardian. In this scenario, the Yotsuba Family may become an existence that will eclipse the Ten Master Clans. Nay…”</p>

  <p>Here, Elder Kudou paused and shook his head.</p>

  <p>“Even in our current predicament, based on the fact that they possess unique abilities unmatched by other families and have a select but extremely powerful group of Magicians, the Yotsuba Family are already a special entity within the Ten Master Clans.”</p>

  <p>Hearing Kudou’s words, Kazama wore a sarcastic smirk.</p>

  <p>“That’s precisely because they loyally obeyed your directive in creating ‘Magicians who are humanoid weapons’. From a pure combat perspective, it is only natural that they are so special.”</p>

  <p>“And therein lies the difficulty.</p>

  <p>Just as you say, Major Kazama.</p>

  <p>They originally existed to develop new weapons, but they are no longer like that.</p>

  <p>Something that only exists as a weapon will someday be excluded from the world of men.”</p>

  <p>“Sir!”</p>

  <p>Kazama curtailed Elder Kudou’s emphatic words.</p>

  <p>“Sir, just as you know the details on my side, so too do I know a few things on your side. I know the real reason why you are so interested in Tatsuya’s situation.”</p>

  <p>This time, it was Kudou’s turn to fall silent.</p>

  <p>“Thus, please allow me to make a suggestion and a correction.”</p>

  <p>“…Please do.”</p>

  <p>“I believe that there is no need to pity Tatsuya. He is not a docile lab rat to be pitied. Rather, he is someone who is reluctant to be viewed in that lens.”</p>

  <p>“That’s your suggestion?”</p>

  <p>“Indeed. Now for the correction… It’s not the near future. Tatsuya is already an invaluable asset within the military. Saying this may seem like I’m promoting my own men, but in terms of military power, Tatsuya is on an entirely different level than Ichijou.</p>

  <p>For point defense situations, Ichijou Masaki rivals an entire armored battallion’s combat strength.</p>

  <p>Yet, Tatsuya alone possesses the might of a strategic warhead.</p>

  <p>His magic is restricted by several layers of limiters and is a bona fide strategic weapon.</p>

  <p>And handing all the responsibility to him alone seems to be an overly heavy and cruel burden.”</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">In the car speeding towards the east, Tatsuya did not double over and sneeze repeatedly.</p>

  <p>The electric car that Fujibayashi was driving — to be precise, Fujibayashi’s car that was being directed by the navigational system, was coursing east along the central highway and reached Yokohama before midnight.</p>

  <p>North of Yokohama Harbor in the east side of town, a sprawling Chinatown still bordered the high rise since the end of the 21st century (despite the multiple military conflicts between Japan and China). It was here that the car carrying the two of them came to a halt.</p>

  <p>“…We know hostile agents are crawling around over here, yet I don’t see any lock down or security checkpoints. What are the politicians thinking?”</p>

  <p>Fujibayashi gazed at the streets in Chinatown and muttered in frustration. Next to her, Tatsuya merely shrugged.</p>

  <p>“That’s because on the surface, this area is one of the primary headquarters for politically oppressed Chinese who fled the country.”</p>

  <p>“That’s a blatant lie!”</p>

  <p>“That’s why I said on the surface.”</p>

  <p>“Everything should have a limit. While we technically won, since no treaty was formally signed, from a legal standpoint, we are still on a war footing with the Great Asian Alliance and are only in a ceasefire right now. Everyone knows that this is a nest for spy activity, but no one wants to deal with it.”</p>

  <p>“Then again, maybe the number of ‘people’ is rising right now.”</p>

  <p>In contrast to Fujibayashi’s nattering, Tatsuya replied in an easy manner.</p>

  <p>Fujibayashi heard — or thought she did — something deeper in that answer and widened her eyes as she stared at Tatsuya.</p>

  <p>“…Do you know something?”</p>

  <p>“No, simply a wish, that’s all.”</p>

  <p>As if signaling an end to the conversation, Tatsuya turned his back to her.</p>

  <p>The current direction he was facing led him to the highest building in the city.</p>

  <p>The cost for construction was staggering, but from a physical perspective, it was indeed the tallest skyscraper.</p>

  <p>Until the middle of the century, this area was known as “Harbor View Park”. Now, with three towering skyscrapers built in the area, one could see Yokohama Harbor and the sea from there.</p>

  <p>The building’s name was the “Yokohama Bay Tower”, which the residents affectionately shortened to “Bay Tower”. It included hotels, shopping centers, civilian offices, television stations and related facilities. The community for Magicians known as the “Japanese Magic Association” also set their eastern branch here rather than in Tokyo. (Main HQ was in Kyoto.)</p>

  <p>Claiming that this tower was only for civilian use was a mere cover that even the citizens in the area could see through. Since this tower was in a perfect location to keep an eye on all the ships entering Tokyo Bay, this building also housed the offices for National Defense and the naval police disguised as civilian companies.</p>

  <p>It was rumored that the Magic Association’s eastern branch was in the building so that they could join the defense if an incident occurred. — Yet regardless of whether it was Tatsuya or Fujibayashi, both knew that this was no “rumor”, but cold, hard “fact”.</p>

  <p>“Lieutenant, thank you.”</p>

  <p>“Looks like I really should apply for overtime.”</p>

  <p>The time was near midnight.</p>

  <p>Fujibayashi placed a small information terminal on an emergency exit that was normally only accessible from the inside and was not covered by security personnel. Her other hand fiddled with the CAD.</p>

  <p>The door mechanism originally didn’t have a connection port or data jack, so Fujibayashi used a hacking program to gain access to the door by modifying the electric conductivity of the door.</p>

  <p>Thanks to Fujibayashi’s interference, the internal surveillance systems failed to detect their presence.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">On top of the highest floor in the Yokohama Grand Hotel — financed by backers out of Hong Kong and built in Chinatown in the first half of the century and had no correlation to the hotel before reconstruction — there was another floor that most customers were oblivious to where men were frantically preparing to move out of a room.</p>

  <p>This room was originally reserved for the eastern branch of the Hong Kong-based criminal organization “No Head Dragon” and served as their operational HQ for eastern Japan.</p>

  <p>The Hong Kong financier who ran this hotel had been compromised by No Head Dragon long ago, hence referring to this place as the operational HQ for criminal activity wasn’t so far off the mark.</p>

  <p>Even calling this moving would be a stretch, as the only things being shifted around were account books that weren’t recorded into devices. Since these were highly classified account books that couldn’t be recorded into systems with extensive safety parameters, they couldn’t simply be handed off to minions to be packed. This was why several middle-aged (and approaching the twilight of their years) men were using silk handkerchiefs to mop away their sweat as they clumsily lugged around luggage with hands covered in jewels and rings. If an outsider was present, they would have found the scene to be exceedingly comical.</p>

  <p>Of course, for the people in question, this was no laughing matter.</p>

  <p>“Damn it… We’ve still got more!”</p>

  <p>One of them stopped working and started cursing furiously.</p>

  <p>“Speaking of which, I can’t believe the Generator was taken out without inflicting any damage…”</p>

  <p>“That was completely unexpected. We didn’t think that Japanese special forces would shamelessly crawl out of the ground.”</p>

  <p>“Thus forcing us to try and evacuate in the middle of the night.”</p>

  <p>“They’re so full of themselves after just winning one battle…”</p>

  <p>Everyone present wished to express the words hidden in their heart to help vent their anxiety.</p>

  <p>“One day, we will avenge ourselves upon the Japanese military, but first we must get rid of that kid.”</p>

  <p>“You’re talking about the son of a bitch who ruined our entire plan?”</p>

  <p>“Shiba Tatsuya right? Who is this guy?”</p>

  <p>“Well… We don’t know all the details. We could only find his name, address, school, and appearance. Forget family situation, we couldn’t even get a list of family members. Only thing we know about his parents is that they are employed, all others remain in the dark. Likewise, we have no personal data beyond normal every day trivialities.”</p>

  <p>“The hell? This country counts as one of the countries with extensive personal databases on the international stage. Even looking at the civilian databases should yield at least some data, isn’t this extremely odd?”</p>

  <p>“Maybe we should see this as instead of classifying personal data, anything related to ‘Shiba Tatsuya’ has been systematically erased. I can’t think of any other possibility.”</p>

  <p>The high-ranking members at the No Head Dragon eastern Japanese branch peered at their compatriot who spoke up and wordlessly glanced at one another.</p>

  <p>“…Maybe he’s not an ordinary high school student…?”</p>

  <p>“If they wanted to systematically alter every personal database at the civilian level, this would require exceptional clearance at the highest level. Otherwise, they need the influence to intervene at the highest level of government.”</p>

  <p>“Seriously, who is it…?”</p>

  <p>They stopped packing their luggage. Suddenly, they heard muffled screams.</p>

  <p>In the corners of the room, four men could be seen.</p>

  <p>They were the Generators lent to the eastern Japanese branch to serve as personal defenses.</p>

  <p>In order to protect against foreign attack, they provided four different types of magic defenses. The Generator responsible for Data Fortification on the walls was precisely the source of these screams.</p>

  <p>The reason was blatantly obvious.</p>

  <p>The south facing wall had a gaping hole in it.</p>

  <p>This was not caused by a collision, incision, or even a crack in the wall. The only remnants were the steel bars and structure hanging loosely with some puffs of yellow dust and settling cement.</p>

  <p>The screams were caused by the destruction of Data Fortification and the subsequent feedback to the caster.</p>

  <p>Still, the painful sounds only lasted for a few seconds.</p>

  <p>The brass swiftly noticed the cause of the screams.</p>

  <p>No Head Dragon was not simply a criminal organization, they were a criminal organization that abused magic.</p>

  <p>In order to rise to the upper echelon, an individual must fulfill the condition of being a Magician.</p>

  <p>They had to manipulate and identify magic.</p>

  <p>Hence they were able to comprehend what unfolded before their eyes.</p>

  <p>The Eidos surrounding the Generator who let out those piteous screams — this was a Magician’s natural defense that unconsciously spread out to automatically protect oneself with Data Fortification — had been stripped away.</p>

  <p>No, the impression was more like the armor was being evaporated.</p>

  <p>In the next instant, the Generator’s whole body was suffused by static-like contour and started fading.</p>

  <p>At this time, the space the Generator’s body used to occupy burst into a small flame.</p>

  <p>Before the sprinklers could come alive, the small flame intermixed with orange, blue, and purple swiftly disappeared.</p>

  <p>What fell to the rug was simply ashes.</p>

  <p>The Generator’s entire body disappeared and this was all that remained.</p>

  <p>The brass was so terrified that they forgot to scream.</p>

  <p>They peered at one another with horrified expressions.</p>

  <p>All of a sudden, the telephone rang.</p>

  <p>The sound came from the hidden land line that only the brass had access to.</p>

  <p>One of them picked up the phone with extreme trepidation.</p>

  <p>There was no image. Only the sound came across the display monitor.</p>

  <p>“Hello, everyone from ‘No Head Dragon’s’ eastern Japanese branch!”</p>

  <p>The voice that came across the speaker was that of a young man — a teenager.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">Tatsuya and Fujibayashi ascended to the roof of the northern building of the Yokohama Bay Tower.</p>

  <p>Here, along with the broadcasting antenna for the television station, there was also a wireless communication device.</p>

  <p>Fujibayashi connected her terminal to the wireless communication device and rapidly tapped the screen.</p>

  <p>“…OK, we’re in. I’ve rerouted every wireless communication through here.”</p>

  <p>“As expected of the ‘Electron Sorceress’. This point remains immune to imitation regardless of what I try.”</p>

  <p>“Thanks. I would be in serious trouble if someone could imitate me so easily.”</p>

  <p>Fujibayashi adopted a superficial smile that obviously didn’t come from the heart.</p>

  <p>“Have we already cut the line?”</p>

  <p>“Captain Sanada already has that end covered.”</p>

  <p>Tatsuya pulled out the speaker attached to the information terminal with his left hand. After punching in the number Fujibayashi passed to him, he pressed the last key to enable voice communication.</p>

  <p>He removed a pair of riding goggles from his jacket pocket.</p>

  <p>Next, he pulled out a long-barreled CAD from his left shoulder holster.</p>

  <p>This was a Specialized CAD shaped like an automatic pistol that was modeled after the Silver Series Long-models.</p>

  <p>He stood before the protective railing and slightly raised his right hand.</p>

  <p>The “muzzle” of the CAD was aimed at the Yokohama Grand Hotel far off near the bottom of the hill.</p>

  <p>“…So that is a ‘Generator’?”</p>

  <p>“Yes, definitely. This is the first time we’ve captured one, but it’s characteristics perfectly match the intelligence report.”</p>

  <p>There was a solid kilometer from the top of the Yokohama Bay Tower to the Grand Hotel’s roof.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya adopted a shooting posture with a pistol-shaped CAD, so of course there wasn’t a scope attached.</p>

  <p>Even so, Fujibayashi never asked: “Can you see it?”</p>

  <p>That was because she understood perfectly that, of course Tatsuya could see it.</p>

  <p>Fujibayashi used an altogether different method of observation than Tatsuya, but even she was perfectly clear on who the Magicians and who the Generators in the room were.</p>

  <p>“Magic tools that have been stripped of their sense of self. So this is the end that awaits all Magicians developed as humanoid weapons…”</p>

  <p>“………”</p>

  <p>“…I spoke too much, I apologize.”</p>

  <p>Feeling Fujibayashi’s cold and disapproving gaze, Tatsuya hastily made amends and apologized.</p>

  <p>Not all Magicians wished to be used as weapons, so his comment was indeed out of line.</p>

  <p>Despite his apology, Tatsuya did not deny that he did resonate with the feeling somewhat.</p>

  <p>There are indeed similarities between the way he and the Generators conducted their lives, Tatsuya thought.</p>

  <p>Precisely because of this, within the remnants of the emotions left to him, the dominant emotion he felt was disgust.</p>

  <p>They were a harmful, unpleasant existence.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya never hesitated when destroying such a “device”.</p>

  <p>Silver Horn Custom, “Trident”.</p>

  <p>This was Tatsuya’s favored instrument, that which brought out the finest of his magic. Tatsuya squeezed the Trident’s trigger.</p>

  <p>His original magic, the military secret “Decomposition” activated.</p>

  <p>This spell broke the wall’s basic components into powder.</p>

  <p>By creating a physical hole in the wall that served as medium, he opened a hole in the “sealed” concept that protected the room from the effect of external magic.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya’s “view” of the interior had never been clearer.</p>

  <p>When the activated magic was forcibly destroyed, the Generator shook from the blow.</p>

  <p>Under normal circumstances, the Magician wouldn’t suffer from the feedback even if the magic was destroyed.</p>

  <p>This was likely a by-product of their inability to consciously terminate or halt magic by themselves.</p>

  <p>He coldly surveyed the scene while his attacks — killing intent did not falter.</p>

  <p>He noticed that one of the Generators released Wide Area Interference to protect the five members of the brass while the three others adopted Wide Area Interference to defend themselves.</p>

  <p>He squeezed the Trident’s trigger.</p>

  <p>He set the “Wide Area Interference” from the Generator injured by the wall’s collapse, the “outer shell of the Eidos”, and “flesh” as the variables and plugged them into the Magic Sequence.</p>

  <p>The processes for all three magics were completed in a split second with no time lag in between.</p>

  <p>The first process decomposed the target’s protective Wide Area Interference.</p>

  <p>The second process decomposed the target’s Data Fortification used to protect the body.</p>

  <p>The third process decomposed the flesh down to the atomic level.</p>

  <p>The decomposition was so complete that it was no longer recognizable as a biological entity and left no traces that this was a living being. Proteins were broken down into hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur; the bones were rendered down to phosphorus, oxygen, and calcium; everything including blood, the nervous system, stored nutrients, even waste was decomposed down to the molecules and ions.</p>

  <p>The lighter elements, with hydrogen at their head, escaped through the hole in the outer wall to the outside.</p>

  <p>The flammable elements interacted with oxygen and burst into flames.</p>

  <p class="break">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent">This scene was so surreal that it seemed like the human body spontaneously ignited.</p>

  <p>Yet, the reality was that it had vanished rather than being consumed by the flames.</p>

  <p>He had incorporated three consecutive Decomposition magics into one Magic Sequence and completely annihilated a Magician’s flesh and body along with its naturally occurring magic protect barrier.</p>

  <p>“Trident… Seriously, this must be what they call having your hair stand on end…”</p>

  <p>This was the Specialized CAD specifically customized to activate three consecutive magics.</p>

  <p>Within the Magic Encyclopedia, the term “Trident” was allocated to another magic.</p>

  <p>However, within the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion, “Trident” referred to this merciless triple Decomposition magic as well as the CAD that optimized the process.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya didn’t hold Fujibayashi’s trepidation or words that slipped out of her mouth against her and merely keyed the waiting information terminal and linked to voice communication.</p>

  <p>Once they invaded the wireless communication device, the authentication system in the dedicated line lost all meaning.</p>

  <p>“Hello, everyone from ‘No Head Dragon’s’ eastern Japanese branch!”</p>

  <p>Tatsuya spoke in an unnaturally cheery voice.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">The executive who picked up the phone failed to hide his befuddlement as he glanced at his peers.</p>

  <p>This was a line reserved for executive use only, as well as a direct line to the main HQ. Only a branch chief or executives from the main HQ would know of this line, as ordinary members were unable to access this line. There weren’t any teenage executives in No Head Dragon. Heck, there weren’t even twenty year old executives in the organization.</p>

  <p>“…Who are you?”</p>

  <p>The voice didn’t contain an interrogator’s edge. Was this because he was quaking on the inside after watching a human body disintegrate into the aether?</p>

  <p>“Much obliged for your work at Fuji.”</p>

  <p>The voice belonged to a teenage youth, but the tone was unmistakably adult.</p>

  <p>“Allow me to return the favor.”</p>

  <p>When these words fell, the Wide Area Interference protecting the brass disappeared without a trace.</p>

  <p>Not only the man who was holding the phone, but everyone still in possession of their wits beside the magic devices glanced towards one corner on reflex.</p>

  <p>Before their eyes, a dimly lit flame ignited and swiftly vanished.</p>

  <p>The sprinklers reacted to the multiple heat sources and inundated the area with high pressured spray.</p>

  <p>The Generator that should be standing there had vanished without a trace.</p>

  <p>“Where? Number 14, where did that come from?”</p>

  <p>One of the executives stammered his words in reverse order.</p>

  <p>Magicians are able to detect what magic was being used and where the attack came from based on the effects of phenomenon rewriting. Normally, there would be no way that they could fail to detect where such a powerful magic that could reduce a human body down to the atomic level came from when the target was so close to them.</p>

  <p>Even if they couldn’t accurately pinpoint the distance, they should at least be able to locate which direction the caster was in — yet this executive had completely panicked and was unable to do anything.</p>

  <p>Compared to those who knew no fear — Generators had already lost their ability to falter, so they remained stolid in the face of their comrade’s destruction.</p>

  <p>Number 14’s slow, plodding movement pointed towards the broken hole in the wall.</p>

  <p>Across the street was the highest point on this street.</p>

  <p>Another executive quickly snatched up a sniper rifle.</p>

  <p>After raising the optical lens to his eye, he raised the magnification.</p>

  <p>On the rooftop of the Yokohama Bay Tower, a youth was partially visible beneath the illuminating moonlight.</p>

  <p>He raised the magnification to the max.</p>

  <p>Even though he couldn’t see the youth’s features because of the riding goggles in the way, he could see the exposed lips smirk at him.</p>

  <p>Seeing that twisted smirk, the man immediately screamed and fell to the floor.</p>

  <p>His eye had been slashed by the shattered lens from the scope.</p>

  <p>Still, the men didn’t have the leisure time to worry about their moaning comrade who clutched at his eye.</p>

  <p>“Number 14, Number 16, kill him!”</p>

  <p>More than one voice ordered the Generators to retaliate.</p>

  <p>However—</p>

  <p>“Unable to comply.”</p>

  <p>“Not within range.”</p>

  <p>Machines cannot accomplish the impossible.</p>

  <p>They were designed to wield magic stably under any condition. With this in mind, Generators didn’t possess the function to use their full potential and surpass their limits.</p>

  <p>“Don’t you dare talk back to me! Attack!”</p>

  <p>At Number 14 and Number 16 simultaneously answering in the negative without any inflection in their voice, the executive on the ground clutching his eye spat back furiously.</p>

  <p>The response came through the phone.</p>

  <p>“Did you really believe I would give you the chance?”</p>

  <p>Number 14 and Number 16 were both consumed by static.</p>

  <p>Both of them followed their comrade to hell.</p>

  <p>“Stop issuing orders to your tools. Why not take up the sword yourself?”</p>

  <p>Before the words traveled over the phone, a slightly mocking laughter could be heard.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the men didn’t seem to have the strength to rouse themselves to a fury.</p>

  <p>That was a distance at which the naked eye couldn’t even make out if someone was there.</p>

  <p>No one present had the ability to use magic against someone who was both unidentifiable and out of range.</p>

  <p>One man sprinted for the land line.</p>

  <p>The others frantically brought up the wireless phones within their terminals.</p>

  <p>Yet, the land line only bleeped back a disconnected signal,</p>

  <p>Nor were the wireless phones working either.</p>

  <p>“Don’t bother. Right now I’m the only one you can speak with.”</p>

  <p>The same voice traveled along the original phone.</p>

  <p>“How is this possible? Even the wireless signal… How did he…”</p>

  <p>“All I did was converge the electronic waves. As to how I did this, there’s no need for you to know.”</p>

  <p>They understood perfectly well the meaning behind his words.</p>

  <p>Still, all those words did was solidify their sense of dread.</p>

  <p>“Now, let’s cut to the chase.”</p>

  <p>With this diabolical declaration, the man clutching one eye was surrounded with static.</p>

  <p>The man’s face twisted in utter despair.</p>

  <p>His face remained twisted — as he turned into ashes.</p>

  <p>Since the sprinklers had already inundated the room thrice with water, there was no longer any spontaneous combustion.</p>

  <p>The men watched with frozen expressions their comrade who was denied even a funeral pyre.</p>

  <p>One man desperately made for the exit.</p>

  <p>Static swarmed around from behind him as his outline came apart and he vanished.</p>

  <p>The last three remaining members of the No Head Dragon’s eastern Japanese branch finally realized that their lives were held in the palm of a demon.</p>

  <p>They couldn’t help but arrive at this epiphany.</p>

  <p>“Wait… Please wait a second!”</p>

  <p>The man who served as the chief of the eastern Japanese branch seized the phone and shouted into the speaker.</p>

  <p>“For what?”</p>
