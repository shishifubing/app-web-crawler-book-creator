  <p>Miyuki, moving from the front,</p>

  <p>embraced him.</p>

  <p>Her face shining with tears buried itself into his chest.</p>

  <p>Such an appearance might be better described as “clinging”, yet that was somehow inappropriate.</p>

  <p>“……I’m on your side.”</p>

  <p>“Miyuki……”</p>

  <p>“I will always no matter what, come what may, be on your side.</p>

  <p>That time will definitely come. Without a doubt, it will come.</p>

  <p>Until then, and forever after, I will always be on Onii-sama’s side.”</p>
