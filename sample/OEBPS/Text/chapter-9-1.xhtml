  <p class="noindent">It was the fifth day of the Nine Schools Competition and the second morning of the Newcomers Division.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya arrived in front of the arena that was busy preparing for the Newcomers Division’s Icicle Destruction.</p>

  <p>Several large cranes were unloading 1 meter x 1 meter x 2 meter icicles from large battlefield vehicles specially modified for this purpose. Seeing this would naturally cause people to believe that the days where super robot anime became reality were not too far off.</p>

  <p>“……If we could completely ignore energy efficiency, that is.”</p>

  <p>“Onii-sama? What are you talking about?”</p>

  <p>As if to reject this outrageous line of thinking, Tatsuya involuntarily started muttering to himself.</p>

  <p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p>

  <p>She did not pursue this vague answer.</p>

  <p>“Let’s go quickly.”</p>

  <p>“Yes.”</p>

  <p>Originally, this was only a stopping point along their route to the competition location.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya urged Miyuki onward towards the resting area located on the top floor of the Arrow Tower.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">There was still 30 minutes until the start of the first round in the morning.</p>

  <p>When Tatsuya entered the arena, there was still plenty of spare time.</p>

  <p>“Good morning!”</p>

  <p>……Still, the players for the first round were already there.</p>

  <p>“Good morning…… Sorry for making you wait so long.”</p>

  <p>“Oh please, I was the one who came too early.”</p>

  <p>The player for the first round of Icicle Destruction, Akechi Eimi, smiled as she shook her head and swept a lock of her ruby red hair back from her face.</p>

  <p>“Good morning, Eimi. How early did you get up?”</p>

  <p>“Good morning, Miyuki. For some reason, I woke up before the alarm went off. It’s like I haven’t recovered from yesterday’s excitement.”</p>

  <p>Her other name was Emilia Goldie. Her full name was Akechi Emilia Goldie Eimi. Eimi was a quarter British stock. Her nickname “Emmy”, rather than originating from her Japanese name “Eimi”, probably came from her British name “Emilia”.</p>

  <p>A Magician’s ability was heavily influenced by genetics.</p>

  <p>Due to the connection between magic and national power, each country jealously guarded its magic bloodlines and either officially or unofficially forbade international marriages between Magicians. (This country that superficially allowed freedom of marriage belonged in the “unofficial” category.)</p>

  <p>Yet, in the generation of Tatsuya’s grandparents, allied countries actively encouraged international marriages between Magicians. The goal was to “cross” “excellent stock” to “develop” superior Magicians.</p>

  <p>The ensuing result was that over half of the current students at magic high schools boasted bloodlines from Western Europe or India.</p>

  <p>Leo was one of them, and the female student known as Akechi Eimi was another.</p>

  <p>As could be inferred from her words, she also appeared in yesterday’s Speed Shooting competition. This was the second day in a row she was working alongside Tatsuya. Besides Miyuki and the two others, Eimi was the first one on the Women’s Team to jell with Tatsuya. For Tatsuya, she was also the most relaxed young lady on the team.</p>

  <p>After the two of them exchanged greetings, they delved into girl talk as Tatsuya smoothly removed the CAD from the case he was carrying, performed a cursory examination, and handed it to Eimi.</p>

  <p>This was a clumsy looking, shotgun-shaped Specialized CAD that measured 50 cm in length and completely dwarfed a young lady’s hand.</p>

  <p>The weapon looked quite heavy, but because recoil wasn’t an issue, the weight was significantly lower than a normal firearm thanks to its lightweight materials. Yet Eimi’s movements were like something straight out of a Western as she swung the gun around and took aim out the window.</p>

  <p>“……Eimi, you’re not British, but American, aren’t you?”</p>

  <p>“How many times do I have to say this, no. Now even Miyuki is saying this too? My grandmother’s family was knighted by the Tudors themselves.”</p>

  <p>Contrary to the content of her words, her tone remained unperturbed.</p>

  <p>She maintained her current posture and started to supply the CAD with psions. Somewhere along the way, the safety was removed. Just like Morisaki’s Quick Draw, this was an entirely different type of pristine CAD drawing.</p>

  <p>“How is it?”</p>

  <p>“Hm…… Now I know how Shizuku feels.”</p>

  <p>Everyone in the 1st Year Women’s Team knew about the fact that the Ojou-sama from the wealthy Kitayama Family wanted to “reserve” Tatsuya.</p>

  <p>“Are there any problems?”</p>

  <p>“Yep, it’s perfect!”</p>

  <p>Eimi relaxed her posture and smiled in delight.</p>

  <p>Apart from her ruby hair and moss green pupils, her outward appearance was thoroughly Japanese. Even among her peers, she was the one who had the most childish impression. Rather than calling her earlier smile “delightful”, a more innocent “teehee” was probably closer to the mark.</p>

  <p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about……”</p>

  <p>Eimi tilted her head at Tatsuya’s muttering, but her smile didn’t fade in the slightest. One of the chief reasons was likely because she had no idea what he was talking about.</p>

  <p>“At least let me run a few calibrations. Can you put on the ear set?”</p>

  <p>“Eh? Why?”</p>

  <p>“Eimi…… In truth, you didn’t get up early, but didn’t sleep at all, right?”</p>

  <p>At being asked this sudden question, Eimi’s smile grew a tad forced.</p>

  <p>“……How could you tell?”</p>

  <p>Seeing Eimi’s widened eyes, Tatsuya silently nodded and, in response, took the CAD from her hands and restarted the calibration process.</p>

  <p>“……You’re sharper than my parents.”</p>

  <p>Eimi obediently put on the headphones used for measurement while nagging with an “I can’t believe you” and placing her hands on the measuring pads.</p>

  <p>Seeing the numbers scrolling down the screen, Tatsuya’s expression darkened.</p>

  <p>With Tatsuya’s minute facial changes, Eimi’s body also started to curl up. This scene didn’t escape Miyuki’s eyes.</p>

  <p>“Well, Onii-sama?”</p>

  <p>There was no reprimand hidden in her words, but when Tatsuya heard her words, he raised his head in realization and smiled as he rubbed the space between his brows with two fingers.</p>

  <p>“Unless Eimi also forgoes Sound Sleep?”</p>

  <p>“Also? You mean Shiba-kun does that too?”</p>

  <p>Eimi’s reaction prompted Tatsuya’s expression to soften somewhat as he nodded.</p>

  <p>“Wow, I discovered a comrade. How should I put this, doesn’t that give you an uncomfortable feeling? Especially those weird sound waves.”</p>

  <p>“There’s no actual health risk…… But I do agree that it is quite uncomfortable. I do make an exception for sleepless nights though. Especially if I have a competition the next day.”</p>

  <p>“OK~.”</p>

  <p>Eimi’s response was perfect for a child that had just been scolded by a parent. Tatsuya could only smile wryly at this.</p>

  <p>“Then, I’ll raise the feedback loop a little higher…… This might be a little irritating, so bear with it for a little bit. Certainly you wouldn’t want to be accused of ‘losing the contest owing to lack of sleep’, right?”</p>

  <p>“I’ll bear with it, please! If that really happened, they’ll never let me live this down.”</p>

  <p>There was nothing worthy of note in her tone. Eimi blushed as she pressed her hands against several interesting points on her pants. Tatsuya paused and was frozen for a solid second.</p>

  <p>“I really didn’t want to bring this up, but, Miyuki…… What do you people do in your rooms?”</p>

  <p>“N, nothing, Onii-sama, Miyuki hasn’t done anything shameful!”</p>
