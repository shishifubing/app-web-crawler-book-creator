  <p class="noindent">In stark contrast to the atmosphere two weeks ago (or to be exact 12 days ago), the hall was filled with a peaceful air.</p>

  <p>While it’s easy to proclaim a neutral spirit, it’s not so easy in practice, and it would be a lie to say that there were none with the thoughts of victory or defeat occupying their mind.</p>

  <p>But now, the fierce competitions of the past 10 days were over.</p>

  <p>The dress code for the festivities was their usual uniforms.</p>

  <p>Once again forced to take up his ill-fitting blazer, he thought, “At least if it comes to dancing will this be better?” A thought which had ended up similar to that of digging his own grave.</p>

  <p>“Popular, huh?”</p>

  <p>Coming up to him with an evil smile was Mari, who had been officially discharged one day earlier.</p>

  <p>“Thank you. To tell the truth, I’d far rather be taking it easy.”</p>

  <p>As if saying it couldn’t be helped, Tatsuya glanced over at his sister, who was surrounded by a crowd two, three layers deep.</p>

  <p>Fellow students, event organizers, base officials who provided the venue, the executives of companies that sponsored the tournament.</p>

  <p>Those were inevitable, but with the inclusion of media professionals (production companies, commercial companies, talent agencies) also dressed up as officials, it made one feel like asking <i>what’s the big idea?</i> to the organizers of the party.</p>

  <p>Truthfully he would have liked nothing more than to forcefully put those noisy and rude people away, but with a shrewd (frosty?) look, Suzune had warned him against such an approach, so he kept a low profile for the moment.</p>

  <p>“I’m not talking about your sister.”</p>

  <p>Hearing Tatsuya’s natural reply, Mari chuckled sadly.</p>

  <p>“The one I’m referring to is you, Tatsuya-kun.”</p>

  <p>From Mari’s point of view, Tatsuya made a tired face.</p>

  <p>Although nowhere comparable to the crowd around Miyuki, Tatsuya had been constantly sought out from the start as well.</p>

  <p>Most of them were unacquainted adults.</p>

  <p>It wasn’t that he had never seen them before.</p>

  <p>Due to his work at his father’s company, despite his age, he knew the faces of businessmen quite well.</p>

  <p>Still, it was only on the level of a “high school student”.</p>

  <p>As a resident of the laboratory, he was not necessarily involved on the business side, but compared to general employees in the same industry he had far more contact than “just a little”.</p>

  <p>Of those who had come to talk with him, he knew more than half of them by sight.</p>

  <p>“Wasn’t that the president of Rozen’s Japanese branch? This would be the first time he talked to a high school student huh?”</p>

  <p>“I wouldn’t know. It’s also my first time here at the Nine Schools Competition after all.”</p>

  <p>“Fair enough.”</p>

  <p>As Mari gave her wicked grin, Tatsuya felt a twinge of annoyance. —In the threshold of around 80% or so.</p>

  <p>“……Well, there’s no helping it. I don’t know why you’re so reluctant, but just as you can tell a fake gem simply by looking at it, when you see the real deal you can immediately tell that too.”</p>

  <p>“……”</p>

  <p>“Don’t put on such a dissatisfied face. The dance is about to start soon. From there on, it’s students only. Just be patient a little longer.”</p>

  <p>Tapping his shoulder, Mari walked over to the drinks table.</p>

  <p>She seemed to be in a good mood for some reason.</p>

  <p>Far more impressive was that despite pushing herself as always even after being wounded, she now seemed to have made a full recovery.</p>

  <p>(So a lover has that kind of effect huh……)</p>

  <p>Although he himself had no experience, Tatsuya couldn’t help but say so to himself.</p>

  <p>Around a minute after that, she left the party with Naotsugu, and Tatsuya uncharacteristically was left to ponder on such things.</p>

  <p>Doing so, he felt like sighing.</p>

  <p>To be certain, very soon, the time allocated for adults to work their tricks on the innocent would be over.</p>

  <p>Yet even so his mind was heavy. The reason was the dance.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">Truth be told, students like Tatsuya were the exception.</p>

  <p>As the bigwigs left, the venue seemed to relax, and a carefree atmosphere filled the air.</p>

  <p>The soft sound of wind and string instruments began to flow.</p>

  <p>At the enthusiasm of the organizers who had prepared an evening of live music, the young men immediately responded.</p>

  <p>Making full use of the trials they had gone through, they took the hands of the girls they had grown closer to, and proceeded to the center of the hall.</p>

  <p>It was unfortunate they weren’t in dresses, but such a fact was utterly irrelevant to them.</p>

  <p>The common dress code for the girls of the nine schools was a silk organdy inner gown (worn under their jacket), which fluttered gently as they moved.</p>

  <p>As expected, Miyuki was being swarmed by boys both from school and from without.</p>

  <p>It seemed no one was capable of staying away.</p>

  <p>Because she was surrounded up until the last minute, she probably hadn’t been able to get a single word out.</p>

  <p>Unlike Tatsuya, Miyuki had been firmly taught manners on how to act at a ball (“it’s not a ‘dance party’!”), so provided proper procedure was observed she was unlikely to refuse a dance partner (naturally, that didn’t mean she’d dance with just anyone), but rather it seemed the boys were being embarrassed on their own.</p>

  <p>From within that crowd, Tatsuya’s familiar face became visible to Miyuki.</p>

  <p>Or rather than saying familiar face, it might be better to say companion.</p>

  <p>Leaving the wall, Tatsuya advanced to the edge of the crowd.</p>

  <p>He was by no means slender, but he skillfully slipped through the press to stand by Miyuki’s side.</p>

  <p>“It’s been two days huh, Ichijou Masaki.”</p>

  <p>“Ah, Shiba Tatsuya.”</p>

  <p>The two exchanged easygoing greetings.</p>

  <p>They didn’t consider themselves friends, yet at the same time, they didn’t think that they needed stiff formalities either.</p>

  <p>“Is your ear alright?”</p>

  <p>“It’s fine, it’s nothing worth being concerned about.”</p>

  <p>“Is that so.”</p>

  <p>At Tatsuya’s (intended) politeness, Masaki returned a quip which could hardly be called amiable. Well, for him who suffered defeat in what by all means should have been a victory, he couldn’t really be expected to happily accept concern from the winners. Although his tone was ambiguous, it certainly held a dismissive air.</p>

  <p>Becoming aware of Miyuki’s cold gaze turned in his direction, Masaki’s heart sank in dismay.</p>

  <p>“Eh, ah…… Ah? Shiba!?”</p>

  <p>He suddenly called out Tatsuya’s last name, causing Tatsuya to make a “is this guy alright?” face.</p>

  <p>“Are you, her brother!?”</p>
