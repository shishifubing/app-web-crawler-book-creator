  <p class="noindent"><b>Hell of Fire and Water (Inferno)</b>: A magic which reverses the heat energy within a set area. Areas of bitter cold and scorching heat occur concurrently in adjacent regions.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Niflheim</b>: A Wide Area Deceleration-Attribute Oscillation-System Magic. The specific heat of the material within the area, regardless of attribute (Phase) is cooled evenly. As a result, a large mass of cold air which contains a fog of liquid nitrogen, Diamond Dust (Ice Needles), and dry ice particles is formed.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Dry Blizzard</b>: A magic which collects the carbon dioxide in the air to produce particles of dry ice. The dry ice flies at high speed by converting the thermal energy produced by the freezing process into kinetic energy.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Thunder Snake Path (Slithering Thunders)</b>: Like [Dry Blizzard], stones of dry ice are produced and water vapor is condensed. This combination magic utilizes Oscillation-System and Dispersion-System Magic to melt the ice, creating a fog of carbon dioxide which has a high electrical conductivity through which a static charge is run through.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Rupture</b>: A Dissipation-System magic which evaporates all liquid within an object. In the case of living organisms, body fluids will evaporate and the body will explode. All fuel will vaporize in internal combustion engines or fuel cells. Since nearly all machines have a fluid of some kind, such as lubricants, coolants, hydraulic fluids, oils, or battery fluids, they will instantly be destroyed by [Explosion] or simply stop working.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Flight Magic</b>: A magic to move through the air via gravity control. It was once thought to be impossible, using a very short duration (a default of 0.5 seconds) of magic invoked in rapid succession, the difficulty caused by an increasing Interference Strength was cleared. It is possible to continue flying so long as the operatorâ€™s Magic Power is in supply.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Vanishing Clouds, Fog Dispersal (Mist Dispersion)</b>: By interfering with the structural information, this magic decomposes substances into molecules such as ions and the basic elements. Direct interference into the structural information of an object is a form of magic of the highest difficulty.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Magic Dissolution (Gram Dispersion)</b>: This magic takes a Magic Ritual and decomposes it into a group of Psion particles without a meaningful structure. Due to the nature of a Magic Ritual acting on the information of an object accompanying a phenomenon, if the information has not been exposed, it is impossible to interfere with the magic. On the other hand, if the Magic Ritual is decomposed, the phenomenon will not occur. To analyze the magic before the magic is activated in the present age where invocation takes a fraction of a second requires the ability to [See] and analyze the magic structure. Since the user is typically required to understand the magic being used beforehand, it is thought utilization of this magic is impossible.</p>

  <p class="noindent">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent"><b>Magic Dismantling (Gram Demolition)</b>: A mass of compressed Psion particles are thrown directly at an object and explode. Any Activation Sequence or Magic Ritual recorded into the Psion Information Body is blown away. Though it is called magic, it is simply a cannonball of Psions that has neither structure nor a Magic Ritual to modify an event, so it is not affected by Zone Interference. Furthermore, the pressure of the cannonball also repels the effects of Cast Jamming. It has no physical effects and cannot be hindered by any obstacle.</p>
