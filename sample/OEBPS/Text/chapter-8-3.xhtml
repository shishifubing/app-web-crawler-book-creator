  <p>She didn’t thump her chest or anything, but at Tatsuya’s relieved look, Shizuku’s expression filled with fighting spirit.</p>

  <p>“The other two won didn’t they?”</p>

  <p>“Yeah.”</p>

  <p>The other two, referred to her teammates who had already gone.</p>

  <p>Those two, who had along with Shizuku advanced to the finals tournament, seemed to have clinched a win in the semi finals as well.</p>

  <p>“It’s fine.”</p>

  <p>Once again, Tatsuya used the same words, but with a different meaning.</p>

  <p>“If Shizuku performs as usual, you’ll definitely win.”</p>

  <p>“Of course.”</p>

  <p>At that, Shizuku gave a brief yet far more vigorous than usual nod.</p>

  <p>“Tatsuya-san has already made all the arrangements I need for victory, so all that’s left is for me to take it.”</p>

  <p>“That’s the spirit.”</p>

  <p>Without challenging her early declaration of success, Tatsuya saw her off with a smile.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">“It’s finally Shizuku-san’s turn.”</p>

  <p>“Hey hey, if even Mizuki is nervous how should I cope?”</p>

  <p>“But aren’t you all excited as well Erika-chan? If Shizuku-san wins here, three of the final best four will be from our school!”</p>

  <p>“Aren’t you a bit too nervous regardless? Shizuku is definitely going to win after all.”</p>

  <p>At that confident affirmation, mingled with a teasing remark from Miyuki to “take a deep breath and calm down”, Mizuki obediently cleared her mind and inhaled.</p>

  <p>“……I wonder if this also counts as a sort of promise.”</p>

  <p>“……I guess even Mizuki-san can be playful at times.”</p>

  <p>Rather than as a result of the deep breathing, but more from not wanting to cause Miyuki and Honoka any more worry, Mizuki finally regained her composure.</p>

  <p>“I wonder what kind of twist we’ll see this time.”</p>

  <p>Hearing Mikihiko’s voice bearing a hint of excitement, Erika made a “huh?” expression.</p>

  <p>“Good point. What will jump out this time, I can’t even begin to guess.”</p>

  <p>The one who actually responded aloud was Leo.</p>

  <p>“His mind is almost like a jack-in-the-box.”</p>

  <p>“You can talk.”</p>

  <p>For Mikihiko to look forward to and show interest in magic was something Erika hadn’t seen for a long time.</p>

  <p>Whether this change had been brought about simply by watching the competition with others, she couldn’t say. Perhaps without her knowing, something had happened between Tatsuya and Mikihiko…… without voicing anything aloud, Erika pondered such things.</p>

  <p>“Eh? That’s……”</p>

  <p>Breaking her out of her train of thought and back to reality was a querulous voice.</p>

  <p>“What is it?”</p>

  <p>“That CAD……?”</p>

  <p>Mikihiko’s gaze was fixed on the CAD Shizuku held under her arm by a strap.</p>

  <p>That rifle shaped CAD at first glance, with the exception of the strap, was no different from the CAD the other contestants were using. But the area of the gun where ammunition would normally be stored was thicker than the others.</p>

  <p>Mikihiko’s school traditionally didn’t place much emphasis on CADs. They still mainly utilized magic activated by charms. But ever since the accident last year, Mikihiko had obsessively been studying up on modern magic technology.</p>

  <p>To compensate for what he had lost.</p>

  <p>The result of that had been evident in his test results.</p>

  <p>Mikihiko had considerably more confidence in CADs than comparable modern mages.</p>

  <p>If his eyes weren’t mistaken.</p>

  <p>“Is that…… a general purpose CAD?”</p>

  <p>“Eh, you’re kidding?”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, well, it is.”</p>

  <p>“I’ve never heard of a general CAD shaped like a rifle before. Firstly, isn’t combining auxiliary sighting systems into a general system technically impossible?”</p>

  <p>It was only natural that Leo, Mizuki, and Erika would ask one question after another.</p>

  <p>But Mikihiko simply shook his head with confidence.</p>

  <p>“The arrangement of the body portion just above the trigger of the CAD is without a doubt FLT’s general purpose ‘Centaur’ series. The Centaur series is a type which doesn’t have any interfaces on the main body and can be used without any external input devices, but the connector has had a grip and auxiliary aim assist system attached.”</p>

  <p>“You really know your stuff.”</p>

  <p class="checkthis">Miyuki’s words as she turned around and grinned confirmed Mikihiko’s observations.</p>

  <p>“Eh? Then, that is?”</p>

  <p>“You’re right Erika. That’s specially handcrafted by Onii-sama. It was specifically made to incorporate auxiliary aiming systems into a general purpose CAD.”</p>

  <p>At Miyuki’s proud words, the knowledge that the CAD was a special made-to-order model, Erika was rendered speechless at the amount of effort that must have taken.</p>

  <p>“I don’t think I could feel any more surprised but…… just what is it all for?”</p>

  <p>“Of course, for the match.”</p>

  <p>Honoka’s brief answer was not near enough to satisfy Leo’s, and the other three’s questions.</p>

  <p>But no subsequent explanation followed through.</p>

  <p>As if by common consent, the six of them faced forwards. The signal for the start of the match began to light up.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">Red and white clay targets danced in the sky.</p>

  <p>Shizuku’s targets were the red ones.</p>

  <p>The three red targets that twisted through the air and entered the scoring zone, flew together towards the center and shattered.</p>

  <p>“Movement system…… no, that’s wrong. Convergence system?”</p>

  <p>In the tent used by each school as a headquarters, large monitors covering every aspect of the competitions gave full view of the matches underway.</p>

  <p>Both Suzune and Mayumi were watching Shizuku’s match on the monitor with their full attention.</p>

  <p>“Correct.”</p>

  <p>This time, all red targets which entered the scoring area were being drawn into the middle and destroyed.</p>

  <p>“That’s the magic used in the qualifiers isn’t it?”</p>

  <p>“Yes. It’s a continuous invocation of convergence magic and vibration magic.”</p>

  <p>Two of the white targets collided and broke apart.</p>

  <p>The opponent from Second High was using an orthodox tactic of targeting the clay itself using movement magic, and turning it into a bullet to hit other targets.</p>

  <p>Although orthodox, its effectiveness had been amply demonstrated by past performances.</p>

  <p>But from the outset, the majority of the targets being removed from around the outer area were white.</p>

  <p>Since most of those had been hit around the outer edge, the problem lay not in the technical ability of the contestant but rather…</p>

  <p>“I get that the area of effect is able to recognize the targets on a macro level and enhance the density of red targets in the center via convergence, whilst displacing the white targets from that center but……”</p>

  <p>The basic form of Convergence Magic works by defining existing space via the Magic Ritual, then taking that defined “data” and selectively manipulating it via designated coordinates using that same Magic Ritual.</p>

  <p>For example, Mayumi’s magic which utilizes dry ice to make bullets and send them flying, in order to create a sufficient number of bullets, initially also uses Convergence Magic to gather carbon dioxide.</p>

  <p>In this case, carbon dioxide is collected in one place while other gases are pushed aside, but this does not mean a high density mass of carbon dioxide is made, as the CO2 rather flows through designated coordinates whilst other gases are drawn out.</p>

  <p>In the same manner, Shizuku’s magic replaced carbon dioxide with red targets.</p>

  <p>A special zone — in this case, the center of the scoring area — was set up as a “space where red targets are gathered” by that Systematic Convergence Magic.</p>

  <p>More specifically a square space 20 meters per side, comfortably covering the entire scoring area and more, was magically altered to become a “space with a high density of red clay targets in the center.”</p>

  <p>The volume of that area is huge, but as the total number of clay targets at any one time is small, there isn’t a large burden on the operator. What is modified isn’t the space itself, but rather the distribution of clay targets within that space.</p>

  <p>The modification of data via the Magic Ritual results in red targets being drawn to the center of the area, while white targets are repelled. The targets the Second High contestant directly controlled weren’t affected by such minor interference, but the targets the Second High student tried to hit, due to not receiving any magic from her, had their trajectories changed by Shizuku’s magic and as a result, white targets began to be missed.</p>

  <p>The rules of the Speed Shooting tournament finals state that as long as you do not directly attack your opponent, interference is allowed. But as the clay targets fly for only short irregular periods, it’s very hard to block your opponent and shoot your own targets at the same time. There were many cases when vacillating between sniping and interfering resulted in self destruction, but as Shizuku’s Systematic Convergence Magic flawlessly linked disturbing the opponent and destroying one’s own targets, it was a very skillful strategy.</p>

  <p>While few, there are some examples of this strategy being used in the past, all of which shared one effect. As strong interference strength is needed, the strategy involves the selection of an appropriate contestant. Therefore while the window of opportunity is small, Mayumi had also firmly studied this tactic.</p>

  <p>So what Mayumi was asking concerning this magic was not that in itself.</p>

  <p>“But then, how is she able to turn on and off the Systematic Vibration Magic at the end?”</p>

  <p>If multiple targets flew together, they would shatter as is.</p>

  <p>If a red target was alone however, vibration magic was used to destroy it.</p>

  <p>It had been configured as a single magic, so for her to be able to independently trigger the Systematic Vibration Magic to destroy targets was peculiar.</p>

  <p>“I wonder if it’s been scheduled that multiple targets would fly together before the Vibration Magic has a chance to trigger?”</p>

  <p>Mayumi’s tone as she reasoned to herself said that not even she believed it.</p>

  <p>There’s no merit to applying such a time difference.</p>

  <p>“Pres, I did say it was ‘continuous invocation of Systematic Convergence Magic and Systematic Vibration Magic’ didn’t I?”</p>

  <p>With a sly smile, Suzune corrected Mayumi’s misunderstanding.</p>

  <p>Mayumi immediately understood the meaning of those words.</p>

  <p>And upon reflection, immediately cried a rebuttal.</p>

  <p>“No way! The systems in a specialized CAD should only be able to store one single Activation Sequence!?”</p>

  <p>“Your doubts are well founded, except that’s not a specialized CAD, but a general one.”</p>

  <p>Suzune’s answer only brought Mayumi still more confusion.</p>

  <p>“That’s impossible! The hardware, OS and architecture between specialized and general CADs are totally different.</p>

  <p>And auxiliary aiming devices are subsystems which only fit within the architecture of a specialized CAD.</p>

  <p>Connecting an auxiliary aiming device to the body of a general CAD is technically impossible isn’t it?”</p>

  <p>Mayumi’s stressful speech gradually settled down, but from the blush of her cheeks it was still possible to glimpse her raw excitement.</p>

  <p>Suzune’s smile, now calm and mature, turned into something to soothe her companion.</p>

  <p>“I thought so too. But, I guess it really is possible. This isn’t something original to Shiba-kun, but was announced in Germany a year ago.”</p>

  <p>“……one year ago, isn’t that pretty much state of the art?”</p>

  <p>“It’s best if you’re not surprised simply by this much, Pres. He’s being real coy about it, but Shiba-kun has something even more cutting edge in store.”</p>

  <p>“Hahh…… Well, if it’s confidential it can’t be helped. But for him to tell Rin-chan about it and not me is a bit of a shock.”</p>

  <p>“The Pres is a contestant. I’m sure he simply didn’t want to upset you.”</p>

  <p>“I guess…… if I had known about a technique like this in advance, I certainly might have become a bit agitated.”</p>

  <p>As their eyes returned to the monitor, the scores of both players and the remaining time were displayed onscreen.</p>

  <p>With the clock ticking down, victory had already been decided.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">(30 seconds remaining)</p>

  <p>Having been repeatedly training these past two weeks, practicing over and over, she was now able to measure exactly the flow of the 5 minutes of the competition.</p>

  <p>The moment red clay flew into the blue sphere projected by her goggles, Shizuku triggered her CAD.</p>

  <p>The target shattered.</p>

  <p>The competition allows the use of the protective goggles to double as a sighting aid. In fact, the number of competitors who don’t do so are rare. (The case of players like Mayumi who have their own sights aside.) However, rather than aiming directly at the target, Shizuku’s functioned as a HMD (head mount display) in order to distinguish space. Or rather, it should be called Tatsuya’s.</p>

  <p>As with all the unorthodox techniques Tatsuya had proposed, Shizuku had also been puzzled with this at first. However, possibly because she had no actual competition experience, she fortunately didn’t take any time to get used to it. Once she was comfortable, it matched her more perfectly than any other equipment or techniques than she would have believed.</p>

  <p>Anyway, it was easy.</p>

  <p>There was almost no stress associated with the normal use of magic.</p>

  <p>Shizuku herself was aware that her weakness was fine control.</p>

  <p>That was why she had requested her CAD engineers to add features that assist in the smoothing of detailed settings.</p>

  <p>Even at the expense of speed, her aim was to ensure that her CAD would be able to output power at a reliable level.</p>

  <p>She was confident her own ability could compensate for the speed of processing.</p>

  <p>However Tatsuya’s Sequences made detailed settings unnecessary.</p>

  <p>Rather than making up for her shortcomings, the concept was to maximize her advantages.</p>

  <p>The intent capitalized on her processing power to continuously trigger a Sequence at high speeds, and her capacity to build large Magic Rituals.</p>

  <p>The result was the CAD she now held in her hand.</p>

  <p>She had been surprised at him being able to connect an auxiliary aiming system to a general type CAD, but she had been even more surprised at the Activation Sequence speed.</p>

  <p>In terms of processing speed, general CADs lose out to specialized ones.</p>

  <p>This was not so much common sense, but rather a matter of structure.</p>

  <p>General and specialized CADs differ both in their hardware and software.</p>

  <p>The difference between them, between a dedicated processor and general processor, is similar to the difference between a dedicated supercomputer and a general one.</p>

  <p>Comparing CPU performance in terms of speed, a generic type will never be the equal of a specialized type. This difference in level can usually be felt clearly.</p>

  <p>And yet — this CAD demonstrated speed no less to that of a specialized CAD.</p>

  <p>(5 more seconds)</p>

  <p>—A target came flying.</p>

  <p>—She pulled the trigger.</p>

  <p>—Magic activated.</p>

  <p>—And the target shattered.</p>

  <p>This processing speed, even when compared with the specialized CAD used during the preliminaries, showed almost no difference.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya had said the trick was because “it was limited to only two Sequences”.</p>

  <p>Since it had been designed exclusively for the competition, he was able to use a trick that would not be viable for daily use.</p>

  <p>Shizuku could not understand the detailed theory.</p>

  <p>She didn’t think it necessary.</p>

  <p>Magic was a tool.</p>

  <p>The CAD was also a tool.</p>

  <p>A tool just needs to be usable.</p>

  <p>Any more than that, could be left to the experts.</p>

  <p>The last two targets weren’t shattered by the “Air Mine”, but by Loop Cast Convergence magic.</p>

  <p>“Perfect.”</p>

  <p>Confirming her performance aloud, Shizuku gave a smile of triumph.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">Noon.</p>

  <p>Inside First High School’s tent, a jubilant atmosphere filled the air.</p>

  <p>“That was brilliant, Tatsuya-kun! What an amazing achievement!”</p>

  <p>Having been patted and slapped on the back countless times, Tatsuya was growing tired. Just as Mayumi’s slender figure suggested there was no actual pain involved, but her persistence was certainly wearying.</p>

  <p>“……Pres, please calm down a little.”</p>

  <p>Making eye contact with Suzune in a plea for assistance, she immediately began to remonstrate with Mayumi.</p>

  <p>Quite the dependable senpai — if not for the fact that she had gone along until being asked for help, making her feel rather more like a “partner in crime”.</p>

  <p>“Ah, I’m sorry.”</p>

  <p>Perhaps having too much fun and finally coming to her senses, Mayumi immediately stopped the slapping. ……but it didn’t seem like she intended to let him go anytime soon.</p>

  <p>“Still, that was truly astounding! We took all first, second and third places!”</p>

  <p>“……the winner, runner-up and third place are all contestants, not me.”</p>

  <p>“Of course Kitayama-san, Akechi-san, and Takigawa-san were also amazing! Everyone did so well!”</p>

  <p>At the Student Council President’s broad smile, the 1st Year women’s Speed Shooting team bowed in unison with a happy “thank you”.</p>

  <p>“But at the same time, your own achievements are no less. They were without a doubt spectacular.”</p>

  <p>Although without Mayumi’s sheer energy, Mari also joined in the praise with a good natured face.</p>

  <p>“Uh, thank you very much.”</p>

  <p>“It’s not like this is a contest. As the engineer who significantly contributed to our contestants’ monopoly of all the placings, you should have your share of the recognition.”</p>

  <p>At Mari’s words, Shizuku and the others nodded deeply.</p>

  <p>“I couldn’t believe it myself.”</p>

  <p>“My magic suddenly became so good, it was like an illusion.”</p>

  <p>Unlike Shizuku, the other two added their own comments.</p>

  <p>Shizuku simply nodded as if everything was a matter of course.</p>

  <p>“Especially concerning the magic Kitayama-san used, there has been an approach from the Universities to officially adopt it into the ‘Index’.”</p>

  <p>However, at Suzune’s words Mayumi’s eyes widened, Mari was lost for words and Shizuku stiffened.</p>

  <p>The official name of the Index is the “National Magic University Compiled・Magic Encyclopedia・Index of True Names”.</p>

  <p>For a magic to have its proper name recorded in the encyclopedia the National Magic Universities are creating, in this context, means the magic would not be considered a subset of any existing magic, but officially recognized by the Universities as an entirely new branch of magic.</p>

  <p>To researchers engaged in the development of magic in Japan, this was the one single honor they all strove for.</p>

  <p>However—</p>

  <p>“I see. Then, please submit Kitayama-san as the developer’s name.”</p>

  <p>“What!? No way!”</p>

  <p>At Tatsuya’s utter lack of interest, Shizuku drew close in a hurry.</p>

  <p>“That was Tatsuya-san’s original magic!”</p>

  <p>“……It’s normal for the developer name of a new magic to be registered as the name of the first user is it not?”</p>

  <p>Distancing himself from Shizuku’s pleas, Tatsuya replied with no tension.</p>

  <p>“Hm……excessive humility is also unpleasant you know?”</p>

  <p>At Mari’s chiding, accompanied by a slightly chilling glance, Tatsuya simply shook his head reluctantly.</p>

  <p>“It’s not humility.”</p>

  <p>“Then what is it?”</p>

  <p>“I just don’t want the shame of having my name registered as the developer of a magic I can’t even use.”</p>

  <p>Certainly, if one is known as the developer of a new type of magic, they are often asked for demonstrations.</p>

  <p>If one is “unable to use” a magic they developed themselves, suspicions would arise that maybe the magic was actually developed by others.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya’s reason was not unjustifiable, but……</p>

  <p>“……Just how then did you manage to confirm the operative readiness of a magic you can’t use?”</p>

  <p>Building up a magic by theory alone is surpassingly non-standard but, even if it were possible, to let another use a magic that was not tested and verified as functional was the work of a mad scientist who ignored all the risks, and it was extremely immoral.</p>

  <p>“It’s not like I can’t use it at all. It’s just that it would take me far too much time to set up, to the point it’s not really at the level you could say I can truly ‘use’ it.”</p>

  <p>“Well well, Mari, Tatsuya-kun, let’s not quarrel over such a thing now.”</p>

  <p>Seeing Mari preparing more ammunition to throw at Tatsuya’s comeback, Mayumi intervened between the two.</p>

  <p>“We’re finally back to a good start. Tatsuya-kun, please help the other competitors just as much.”</p>

  <p>As Mayumi tapped his shoulder with a smile, Tatsuya gave a modest bow.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">The performance of First High School’s women’s Speed Shooting team had created a stir in the other schools.</p>

  <p>There was an enthusiastic feeling of “we can win this year” throughout the Nine Schools Tournament, especially Third High School, who thought of the accident in the women’s Battle Board “we feel bad for them, but this is a chance!” — While such thoughts may seem excessive, they were shared amongst the others.</p>

  <p>“So Masaki, First High’s performance, you don’t think it was due to the personal skill of those girls themselves?”</p>

  <p>Of the twenty people gathered — all the 1st Years of the Third High School Newcomer’s Battle contestants —</p>

  <p>“It has to be said, the magical power of the winner, that Kitayama girl, is astounding. I’m sure she would have won either way. But the other two, I don’t feel were anything special. If the results had been decided by magical power alone, I’m sure they wouldn’t have gone so far as to claim second and third place as well.”</p>

  <p>“Not to mention that the advantage in Battle Board lies with us this year, seeing how I think First High only has one 1st Year in it with a particularly high level.”</p>

  <p>The results of the Battle Board so far had seen the two guys from Third High School both qualify, and of the two girls they sent forth one had qualified. By contrast only one of the men from the three First High School sent qualified, and the one girl they sent qualified too.</p>

  <p>“It’s as George says. We don’t lose out in terms of the quality of our contestants. If that’s so, there must be some other factor.”</p>

  <p>“Ichijou-kun, Kichijouji-kun……what do you think it is?”</p>

  <p>At the question from the girl who had lost to First High in the semifinals of the Speed Shooting, both Ichijou and Kichijouji made eye contact, confirming their suspicions.</p>

  <p>“It’s probably, their engineer.”</p>

  <p>Kichijouji responded out loud.</p>

  <p>“The engineer for their women’s Speed Shooting team is probably quite the ace.”</p>

  <p>“I concur. George, the device that winner girl used……did you notice?”</p>

  <p>“Yeah……that was a general purpose wasn’t it.”</p>

  <p>Kichijouji’s answer, aside from the two of them, made a considerable impact on the other Third High 1st Years.</p>

  <p>“No way……I mean, it had auxiliary sights attached right?”</p>

  <p>“That’s right! I’ve never heard of a general purpose device shaped like a rifle either!”</p>

  <p>“That’s true. Whichever maker’s catalogue you look through, you’d never find anything like that would you?”</p>

  <p>At the objections being raised, Ichijou remained somber.</p>

  <p>“……certainly, something like that has never commercially appeared. However, examples of general devices with integrated sighting aids do indeed exist.”</p>

  <p>“You gotta be kidding……”</p>

  <p>At Ichijou’s words, stunned voices floated through the air.</p>

  <p>In fact a strong air of disbelief permeated throughout, until Kichijouji came out with his own support.</p>

  <p>“It’s new technology, only just announced in Dusseldorf last summer.”</p>

  <p>“Just last summer!? That’s freakin’ state of the art!”</p>

  <p>“Yeah, I didn’t know either until I looked into it for this thing.”</p>

  <p>“Not even Ichijou knew, there’s no way we would……”</p>

  <p>An uncomfortable silence followed. Surprise, anxiety, doubt……and awe.</p>

  <p>“……Kichijouji-kun sure knows a lot though. As expected of our brain.”</p>

  <p>The words of that female competitor were intended to loosen up the heavy atmosphere.</p>

  <p>But Kichijouji remained unmoved.</p>

  <p>“Sure……but, the prototype unveiled in Dusseldorf was not meant to be a practical model. The operation was sluggish, accuracy was low — from a technical standpoint it was simply an experiment that had been cast aside.”</p>

  <p>Kichijouji knotted his brow as he replied, his voice bitter.</p>

  <p>“The device the winner First High’s Kitayama-san used however fully combined the strengths of the speed and accuracy of a specialized type with the versatility of a general type. If that was all the work of one engineer……that’s not the level of a high school student anymore. It’s almost monstrous.”</p>

  <p>“Masaki, for you to describe someone that far……”</p>

  <p>“It’s physically impossible for a single engineer to be responsible for every competitor though……”</p>

  <p>“Competitions that guy is responsible for in the future are likely to be beastly. It’s very likely our devices will be handicapped by at least two or three generations.”</p>

  <p>At Kichijouji’s ominous speculation, silence reigned amongst the gathered teammates.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">Tatsuya, who was at this moment receiving such unjust treatment from the athletes in their rival schools without any knowledge (obviously) after finishing a late lunch proceeded to the girls’ Battle Board course.</p>

  <p>Planned for the afternoon were the fourth to sixth races.</p>

  <p>Honoka would appear in the sixth. If he only needed to keep his appointment with her, there should be no need to come so early.</p>

  <p>“Ah, Shiba-kun, what’s the matter?”</p>

  <p>At the sight of him accompanied by Miyuki and Shizuku, Azusa tilted her head. Her posture was so similar to a squirrel holding a nut that despite his melancholic mood, he couldn’t help but twitch a smile.</p>

  <p>At his careless chuckle he consciously tried to tighten his lips, but there wasn’t enough tension. In resignation, he relaxed.</p>

  <p>“……You were making fun of me just now weren’t you?”</p>

  <p>“Not at all. I was just impressed by Nakajou-senpai’s diligence.”</p>

  <p>“……You really are making fun of me aren’t you?”</p>

  <p>Being glared at with those half-lidded eyes so much like a child sulking forced Tatsuya to look away to hold back his laughter.</p>

  <p>“……It’s fine, I don’t care.”</p>

  <p>Azusa kept glaring at him for a while, then with a sigh, muttered to herself.</p>

  <p>This was probably something she went through every day.</p>

  <p>Somehow, her figure also exuded an air of melancholy.</p>

  <p>Leaving her like that would make one feel terrible.</p>

  <p>“—I really wasn’t making fun of you.”</p>

  <p>“……Really?”</p>

  <p>“Really.”</p>

  <p>“Really really?”</p>

  <p>“Really.”</p>

  <p>Being looked at with suspicion — due to the height difference, straight up — by Azusa, Tatsuya showed a strong front.</p>

  <p>Seeing that proud bearing, Azusa finally seemed to relent (was she fooled?) and smiled.</p>

  <p>“Alright. Because I believe in Tatsuya-kun.”</p>

  <p>Saying so as she laughed at him, she drifted over to his side.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya knew without even looking.</p>

  <p>The image of Miyuki’s eyebrows rising floated into his mind.</p>

  <p>(Ooh boy……)</p>

  <p>It seemed his sister would be in a pretty bad mood tonight as well, he sighed to himself — although he couldn’t resent her for it, it did pain him a little inside.</p>

  <p>—That aside.</p>

  <p>“So, what’s the matter? There’s still two more hours before Mitsui-san’s match.”</p>

  <p>“I felt rather uncomfortable outside, so I came here for some shelter.”</p>

  <p>As Azusa tilted her head again, next to Tatsuya, Miyuki laughed.</p>

  <p>“……Onii-sama is too concerned.”</p>

  <p>At those questioning eyes, Miyuki’s tone suggested “it can’t be helped”.</p>

  <p>“They’ve become very motivated, so I’m sure the end result will be just fine.”</p>

  <p>On his other side, Shizuku reassured him.</p>

  <p>“Ah, ahhh, is that what it is……”</p>

  <p>Guessing the circumstances immediately, Azusa was pretty sharp too.</p>

  <p>The monopoly of Shizuku and the others had been the subject of praise even throughout lunch.</p>

  <p>Not just the executives, but the seniors who had the day off and had been watching that day went to compliment the three, yet the number of people who also went on to mention Tatsuya’s achievements were not inconsiderable.</p>

  <p>At that, the men’s Speed Shooting team had begun burning with an extraordinary rivalry.</p>

  <p>That in itself, as Shizuku said, was not undesirable.</p>

  <p>If they become fired up and increase their desire for victory, as long as they aren’t idle, it works as a plus.</p>

  <p>However, being stared at with eyes that seemed to burn with vengeance for their dead father, made you want to tell them to get a life.</p>

  <p>Of course, to say such a thing out loud would lead to a fight. In order to avoid unnecessary trouble, he had come to the competition venue as early as possible.</p>

  <p>The location of the Nine Schools Tournament was the southeast area of the Fuji Armed Forces Training Grounds. While it’s called an area, the Fuji training grounds were huge to begin with, and simply moving between venues would end up being a considerable hike. Without that much land, it would be impossible to prepare for areas such as the Battle Board course and the Monolith Code battlefield.</p>

  <p>The Battle Board course was a winding flume circuit of approximately three kilometers.</p>

  <p>With two sets for the two genders, as well as the spectator stands meant that quite a bit of land was needed just to make this course.</p>

  <p>When considering moving around the venue, the Battle Board course had been constructed right at the edge of the area provided for the Nine Schools Tournament in order to avoid having to bypass that large course on the way to other venues, and it can safely be said that there were no competitors from other events around such as those participating in the concurrent men’s Speed Shooting.</p>

  <p>“I could also have gone back to the dorm, but I decided since I’ll be coming here anyway I might as well see if there’s anything I could help with.”</p>

  <p>“Really!?”</p>

  <p>It wasn’t just Azusa who raised a cry.</p>

  <p>Perhaps overhearing from somewhere, Honoka suddenly came flying out from the competitor’s area.</p>

  <p>“Then please, by all means! Have a look at my CAD!”</p>

  <p>Recently, under the influence of Tatsuya, Honoka had also began calling her device not “Assistance” but “CAD”. At Honoka’s momentous leap Tatsuya had almost laughed out loud again. Tightening his face against the impulse, he scolded Honoka.</p>

  <p>“Hey, come on Honoka. That way of speaking is kinda rude to Nakajou-senpai you know?”</p>

  <p>Honoka’s attitude, and her words just now, couldn’t help but be taken as some level of dissatisfaction at Azusa’s work.</p>

  <p>“Eh, ah, I’m very sorry!”</p>

  <p>Honoka lowered her head in a hurry.</p>

  <p>“Don’t worry about it. I know you didn’t mean it in that way.”</p>

  <p>Azusa shook her head with a dry smile.</p>

  <p>Her tone was almost sisterly.</p>

  <p>Resisting his urge to laugh this time was a difficult task.</p>

  <p class="break">&nbsp;</p>

  <p class="noindent">The average time for a Battle Board round was about 15 minutes.</p>

  <p>However, the loading and unloading of the boards as well as the inspection of the waterway, as well as the repair of areas damaged by magic meant more time was needed to prepare for each race.</p>

  <p>Allowing for that, as well as extra time to give leeway, meant the competition schedule for Battle Board had been organized into blocks of one hour.</p>

  <p>The final race would begin at 3:30 in the afternoon. Already, players were moving to the starting positions. The too long wait time was not good for tense nerves, and there were many instances of competitors ending up being unable to utilize their full strength (every year, such examples would occur for both genders in both the “real” finals and the Newcomers division), but possibly because of the chatter Honoka had shared with Miyuki and Shizuku before the match, she seemed in great condition as she stood poised upon her board.</p>

  <p>The sight of Honoka constantly sticking to Tatsuya had gradually stirred up Miyuki’s mood, but instead of separating them she had gone along and entered into their chat, the result of which seemed to have been a positive diversion for Honoka.</p>

  <p>The heavy swim shoes and thick wet suit that covered the wrists and ankles were meant to protect the competitor’s body from the friction of impacts and falling. But the pressurized uniform stuck fast to the wearer, and sharply emphasized the curves of the body even more than usual.</p>

  <p>Over the thigh, in large letters, was the logo “ICHIKO”. With her stimulating proportions unbefitting a 1st Year highlighted by her colorful wet suit, Honoka crouched with one knee upon the board awaiting the start.</p>

  <p>The CAD over her forearm was thinner and wider than usual, increasing its area and allowing for larger buttons. As he had said earlier, Tatsuya did not tamper with Honoka’s CAD.</p>

  <p>After looking over the system, he found nothing which absolutely needed work.</p>

  <p>Being asked for advice by both Honoka and Azusa, he had just one thing to offer.</p>

  <p>The dark goggles that Honoka now wore had been brought by him.</p>

  <p>To be sure, the midsummer sunshine was inclining in from the west to the extent that facing that way directly would be uncomfortably dazzling.</p>

  <p>Due to water splashing on the glass and blocking their view, however, few competitors opted to use goggles or sunglasses.</p>

  <p>Azusa had felt that narrowing the field of view would only be a disadvantage, but Honoka had taken the goggles without hesitation.</p>

  <p>“……come to think of it, why has Mitsui-san prepared so many optical Activation Sequences?”</p>

  <p>It’s rare for an engineer to issue Activation Sequences.</p>

  <p>With the exception of Tatsuya, who plans out the Activation Sequence lineup himself, normally engineers install Sequences based on the wish of the competitors.</p>

  <p>Azusa had known too that Honoka was adept with illusionary magic of the light wave system from her profile, but due to the nature of the competition, Azusa had honestly believed there was no place for illusionary magic.</p>

  <p>“The rules of Battle Board state that interfering with other players via magic is prohibited. However, interfering with the water and thus indirectly interfering with other players is not.”</p>

  <p>“……what does that mean?”</p>

  <p>Despite being asked repeatedly by Azusa, Tatsuya had only returned an evil smile.</p>

  <p>The signal for the start of the sixth qualifying race of the Newcomer’s women’s Battle Board came on.</p>

  <p>Immediately after.</p>

  <p>The audience in near unison turned away from the waterway. As if lit up by a flash, the water surface poured out light.</p>

  <p>One competitor fell overboard.</p>

  <p>The others had their balance disrupted whilst in the midst of accelerating, and one lone figure dashed to the front.</p>

  <p>As if expecting the situation — although it has to be said that she was the one who created the situation — wearing dark goggles, that lone figure was Honoka.</p>

  <p>“Alright.”</p>

  <p>Looking up at Tatsuya, who gave a voice of affirmation, Azusa’s face was full of amazement.</p>

  <p>“……Was this Onii-sama’s strategy?”</p>

  <p>Miyuki’s voice as she removed her sunglasses was also filled with wonder. (By the way the sunglasses the three of them wore had been issued beforehand. Miyuki and the others had been mystified as to their purpose, but put them on anyway.)</p>

  <p>“To be sure, it’s not prohibited by the rules but……”</p>

  <p>Shizuku’s voice had a hint of reproach in it.</p>

  <p>One couldn’t help feeling that this was rather against the spirit of fair play.</p>

  <p>However the yellow flag which would indicate any significant unfair play remained unwaved, and the match continued. The red flag that signaled a player’s disqualification for rules violations likewise remained unused.</p>

  <p>It meant that the tournament committee deemed Honoka’s magic, and Tatsuya’s strategy, a legal move.</p>

  <p>“……Performing optical magic on the water’s surface, I didn’t expect that at all.”</p>

  <p>Her personality straightforward at all times, Azusa muttered in admiration.</p>

  <p>“Interfering with the water surface, whether to generate waves or vortexes, affects the consciousness and orientation of other competitors yet it is allowed since it complies with the rule that ‘you may affect another competitor via magically targeting the water surface’. Doing something like freezing the water solid or boiling it would certainly be too dangerous, but I did find it strange that no one until now had used it to cause dizziness.”</p>

  <p>If one is suddenly blinded without any warning, it takes a while to restore vision.</p>

  <p>Meandering slowly along the course, unable to sprint due to their obscured vision, the difference between Honoka and the other players was already decisive.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">“……It’s in the bag.”</p>

  <p>“……Who thought of this strategy?”</p>

  <p>Mayumi who was watching through the monitor did not experience any discomfort as the monitor automatically adjusted the amount of light displayed, yet now while she was calmly assessing the originality of that tactic she remembered her initial surprise (although calm surprise is a bit of an oxymoron).</p>

  <p>Following behind Mari’s mutter and Mayumi’s question, Suzune answered.</p>

  <p>“It was Shiba-kun.”</p>

  <p>“Eh, but I thought Tatsuya-kun wasn’t involved in this match?”</p>

  <p>Hearing that answer, Mayumi tilted her head as if going “huh?”</p>

  <p>Suzune’s reply was possibly a bit too polite.</p>

  <p>“The one who submitted the plan in the first place was Mitsui-san. But the one who decided the Activation Sequence lineup and brushed up the finer details of the strategy was Shiba-kun, or so I’m told.”</p>

  <p>Suzune’s deliberate mention of him “deciding the Activation Sequence lineup” was because of the perception that doing so was the exception, not the rule.</p>

  <p>“……it really is one thing after another with him, isn’t it.”</p>

  <p>A touch of reproach could be heard in Mari’s voice.</p>

  <p>“What’s the matter? You seem somewhat dissatisfied.”</p>

  <p>Mari didn’t answer Mayumi’s question.</p>

  <p>However, her silence itself spoke volumes on what was on her mind,</p>

  <p>“……Planning is very important. As the masters say.”</p>

  <p>From what Mayumi could tell, Mari was cranky at being shown a tactic she hadn’t thought of. For Mari who prided herself on being a strategist, it decidedly wasn’t very fun.</p>

  <p>“It’s a tactic no one has thought of for nine years, so this is the point where you should be nice and impressed.”</p>

  <p>“……I am impressed. That’s why I’m so annoyed.”</p>

  <p>Being cut into by Suzune, reluctantly, Mari admitted her jealousy.</p>

  <p>Mari was magnanimous enough to accept it, so Suzune let her off for now.</p>

  <p>“Still, this is a one-off strategy isn’t it? I wonder what he’ll do for the finals?”</p>

  <p>Mari didn’t come up with a follow through, so Mayumi responded instead.</p>

  <p>“No worries. There’s no way that man hasn’t thought that far ahead.”</p>

  <p>“That’s true. This is also just a strategic move for the next match.”</p>

  <p>Seems like it was a needless anxiety.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">“Yeah……seems like I’ve done something bad to Honoka.”</p>

  <p>Watching Honoka take the lead from her earlier move, and maintain it all the way until the finish, Tatsuya muttered in a bitter voice. Next to him, Miyuki looked up at her brother’s clouded face.</p>

  <p>“……What’s the matter?”</p>

  <p>Their appearance was noticed by others, and Azusa spoke up to Tatsuya.</p>

  <p>“Ah, nothing……”</p>

  <p>His answer was evasive, or in other words an excuse.</p>

  <p>Still, he didn’t become silent.</p>

  <p>“She could have won this race easily based on her speed alone……there was no need for the confusion.”</p>

  <p>“Well……even so, she did take the lead thanks to her initial dazzle, so couldn’t you still call it a successful strategy?”</p>

  <p>Azusa, not knowing the nature of Tatsuya’s regret, tilted her head.</p>

  <p>“When you stand out so much, it’s going to mean you’ll be marked by the other contestants……”</p>

  <p>“The semis are a race between three people……it’s a possibility that in the next match, the other two will pair up.”</p>

  <p>Miyuki complemented Tatsuya’s words.</p>

  <p>Finally, Azusa understood what they were worried about.</p>

  <p>“Oh, is that what it was.”</p>

  <p>And laughed at their concerns.</p>

  <p>“Something like that……I’m pretty sure it’d be a disadvantage right?”</p>

  <p>At Miyuki’s countering hesitance, Azusa merely shook her head happily.</p>

  <p>“That won’t happen, since we’ve been marked from the start.”</p>

  <p>“Haahh……”</p>

  <p>She had said it so cheerfully that for a moment Tatsuya wondered if she was actually proud of that.</p>

  <p>—Well, just for a moment.</p>

  <p>However insensitive he was, he wasn’t so far gone as to not realize she was just comforting them.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">“I won! I won, Tatsuya-san!”</p>

  <p>As soon as she rose from the waterway, Honoka immediately hurried over to where Tatsuya and the others were without even changing from her wetsuit, hopping all the way.</p>

  <p>“Ah, yeah. We saw. Well done.”</p>

  <p>Aware of the other staff who had come down to greet their teammates, Tatsuya hastily put both hands out in front of him while congratulating her in an attempt to calm her down.</p>

  <p>But it had the opposite effect.</p>

  <p>“Thank you so much!”</p>

  <p>Perhaps misunderstanding, Honoka clasped the hands Tatsuya held out and stared up at his face, tears of joy threatening to spill out from her eyes. Even Miyuki didn’t expect her to show her emotions so straightforwardly.</p>

  <p>While Tatsuya stood frozen from a lack of experience with such things, Honoka really did start to cry.</p>

  <p>“Whenever it comes to competitions, I become so weak……I hardly ever win competitions in athletic meets or tournaments like these.”</p>

  <p>It was the first time he heard of this. If that were true, then maybe using the strategy in the Newcomer’s division wasn’t such a miscalculation after all.</p>

  <p>But as Tatsuya stood helplessly looking left and right, behind Honoka the figure of Shizuku waving her hands flew into view.</p>

  <p>From her appearance, it seemed she was saying “that’s not the case, not at all.”</p>

  <p>With his hands still firmly grasped by Honoka, and establishing line of sight with Shizuku, she began to mouth words to him. Her lip movements read “she’s・talking・about・during・primary・school”.</p>

  <p>(A story from their primary school days, huh……)</p>

  <p>Tatsuya sighed whilst looking towards heaven.</p>

  <p>She probably didn’t intend to lie or anything……but her conviction was just a little too intense.</p>

  <p>Despite the icicle glare Miyuki directed at him (that is to say icy cold, and very sharp), he still required some time to regain his composure.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">Both in athletics and on the board, if one does not have the will then victory will be uncertain.</p>

  <p>It’s the same with magic competitions.</p>

  <p>Looking at the success of one’s teammates and thinking “now it’s my turn” is a system which raises the willpower of the team, and is like a magic bullet which boosts morale.</p>

  <p>“Willpower” is linked with “fighting spirit”, but “fighting spirit” also easily links to “futility”.</p>

  <p>Before the girls’ eyes, such an event was occurring.</p>

  <p>“Morisaki-kun was the runner-up, but……”</p>

  <p>Mayumi’s words were wrapped in disappointment.</p>

  <p>“The other two missed the cut huh……”</p>

  <p>Mari’s words continued the disappointed trend.</p>

  <p>At the close of the first day of the Newcomer’s Division, in the meeting room, the 3rd Year executives stood before the results of the men’s Speed Shooting rankings and let out a collective sigh.</p>

  <p>“The results of the men’s and women’s are reversed……”</p>

  <p>“I wouldn’t say that. Third High took first and fourth place, so the girls still give us a positive balance.</p>

  <p>You’re being just a little too pessimistic.”</p>

  <p>Suzune’s sober analysis countered Mayumi’s gloomy remarks. It was all in an effort to dispel the stagnant mood.</p>

  <p>“……Right. As Ichihara said, it’s not good to be too negative. In the first place, the results of those girls are far more than we could have expected. We must be positive about the lead they have given us today.</p>

  <p>“But the slump with the guys isn’t just in ‘quickdraw’. In ‘surfing’ as well, only one guy qualified compared to two girls.”</p>

  <p>At Mari’s remarks, in a tone as if reminding herself, Katsuto agreed with a grim look. (By the way “quickdraw” is a nickname for Speed Shooting, as “surfing” is for Battle Board.)</p>

  <p>“If their poor performance continues like this, even if we do well this year it’s possible we’ll be disadvantaged in the years to come.”</p>

  <p>“That losing would become a habit?”</p>

  <p>“It is a possibility.”</p>

  <p>At Katsuto’s point, both Mari and Mayumi bitterly fell silent.</p>

  <p>Being leaders of a Magic High School, especially the executives of First High who prided themselves upon victory, they were unable to live with the easy thought “we did good enough this year”.</p>

  <p>“The mens’ side may require some support.”</p>

  <p>“Still Juumonji, even if you say support what can we do at this late hour?”</p>

  <p>Mari’s rebuttal to Katsuto’s murmur was bitter.</p>

  <p>It was certainly a “late hour”.</p>

  <p>The Newcomer’s Division had already begun. It wasn’t possible to change the staff or competitors anymore.</p>

  <p>Even when she glanced at him, Katsuto had no reply.</p>

  <p>That atmosphere however, rather than being at a loss, gave the impression not of mere silence but that a plan was forming.</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">At last tomorrow, or rather “today” already, was Miyuki’s turn.</p>

  <p>There had been no move from the organized crime related sabotage warned of by Kazama since the incident involving Mari, but Tatsuya couldn’t put it out of his mind.</p>

  <p>If his hypotheses were correct, the “enemy” had tampered with the CADs just prior to the competition. It was a low possibility for more sabotage to be carried out overnight, but it never hurt to double check.</p>

  <p>For the enemy’s actions to be immediately undetectable by him, they held very high skill.</p>

  <p>Finishing the final adjustments, he systematically tightly locked the CAD, then further added a triple lock before finally stopping work.</p>

  <p>There isn’t a trace of any other person.</p>

  <p>Not just humans, but no other life signs could be detected at all.</p>

  <p>In regards to the enemy, it would be expected that security here is much higher.</p>

  <p>Kazama and his subordinates, the elites of the Independent Magic-Equipped Battalion were secretly helping behind the scenes, so even if there was an attempt, a direct attack was unlikely to succeed.</p>

  <p>Without wandering around unnecessarily, he proceeded through the entrance of the hotel (of course, requiring bio-metric identification), and went straight to his room.</p>

  <p>Before he entered, he noticed at the door.</p>

  <p>His only roommates were non-breathing machines.</p>

  <p>At this time of night, when he was confident the minute hand of the clock should be announcing a date change any time now, there shouldn’t be any sign of life aside from him in the hallway — but he turned the key and walked inside regardless.</p>

  <p>“Hey now, just what time do you think it is?”</p>

  <p>Unlike usual, his slightly stern voice seized the initiative.</p>

  <p>Unlike usual, his posture suggested this wasn’t something that could be let off with a smile.</p>

  <p>Unlike usual, the one on the receiving end of all this must have realized that as well.</p>

  <p>Her shoulders trembling, Miyuki hastily got up off the bed she had been sitting on, and fearfully looked up at her brother.</p>

  <p>“A lack of sleep will reduce your ability to concentrate. Even if it’s you, where careless mistakes may not necessarily lead to defeat, that won’t always be the case.”</p>

  <p>“I’m very sorry!”</p>

  <p>Being scolded by Tatsuya in earnest, Miyuki bowed deeply in a voice verging on tears. Hearing his sister like this, seeing her like this, Tatsuya was simply unable to keep up his tough stance for any longer.</p>

  <p>“……It’s good you understand. Now come on, let’s go back to your room. I’ll escort you there.”</p>

  <p>Perhaps his voice was a little too forceful, as when Miyuki timidly looked up, she refused to look at her brother’s face.</p>

  <p>“Miyuki?”</p>

  <p>“……Onii-sama, for a bit, just a bit, could I have a little of your time?”</p>

  <p>“……Just a little.”</p>

  <p>A competition in obstinacy would be a waste of time.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya knew from prior experience that his sister was rather passively aggressive in this way.</p>

  <p>“I heard from Shizuku. Onii-sama, you turned down the honor of having your name added to the ‘Index’.”</p>

  <p>“Not formally at least.”</p>

  <p>“Rather than formally or anything, you were prohibited weren’t you?”</p>

  <p>“Yeah.”</p>

  <p>At Tatsuya’s brief affirmation, Miyuki, as if struggling with something, stood whilst biting her lip a while.</p>

  <p>“……Was that, upon the orders of our Aunt?”</p>

  <p>“Yeah.”</p>

  <p>Another brief affirmation.</p>

  <p>Miyuki, once again teary eyed, looked down.</p>

  <p>“The investigative powers of the Magic Universities are very high. The gossip sites masquerading as news sites of normal media organizations can’t even begin to come close. They’re almost comparable to military or intelligence agencies.</p>

  <p>Developers of new magic in addition to being given access to the resources of the Universities are also granted various privileges, but their identity is also examined in detail. It’s in order to root out national spies and terrorists. It’s an investigation on a totally different level to high school admission. It’s not unlikely they’ll discover not only my identity as ‘Silver’, but ‘Shiba Tatsuya’s’ identity as a Yotsuba which the Yotsuba themselves have been blocking so carefully.”</p>

  <p>Faced with his sister’s tears, Tatsuya explained in a slightly cool voice.</p>

  <p>It was not only because he had to be uncompromising in the face of her tears, but because he had to convince himself.</p>

  <p>“……”</p>

  <p>For a while, her head bowed, Miyuki said nothing.</p>

  <p>Tatsuya felt relief at not hearing her sob anymore.</p>

  <p>“To be sure, just entering the Nine Schools Competition carried some risk of my identity coming under scrutiny. However, leaving my name in the Magic Encyclopedia is far different from being in a high school competition. The ‘Guardian’ of the Yotsuba exists as a shadow. Do you think for such an outcast to be in the limelight would be acceptable to our Aunt?”</p>

  <p>Miyuki kept silent. She didn’t even mouth any words of comfort.</p>

  <p>That was her answer to his question.</p>

  <p>“For now, I still don’t have enough power. In a head on situation, there is a possibility I could defeat the ‘Queen of Night’ Yotsuba Maya. My ‘Decomposition’ has good compatibility as a counter to her ‘Night’ after all.</p>

  <p>But the me as of now, even if I could beat our Aunt, I can’t do anything about the Yotsuba. Force of arms alone, the threat of violence alone is not enough. If I displace our Aunt, another worse manipulator would simply show up in her place. At this moment, I can only follow.”</p>

  <p>Those words weren’t so much to convince his sister, as for himself.</p>

  <p>As he tried to satisfy himself that way,</p>
