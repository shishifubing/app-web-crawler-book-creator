  <p>He hadn’t actually thought his words through.</p>

  <p>He didn’t believe his opponent was going to let him go.</p>

  <p>No one who could eradicate men like mere numbers possessed a merciful disposition.</p>

  <p>Still, contrary to expectations, a response came down the line.</p>

  <p>“We, we swear to never interfere with the Nine Schools Competition again!”</p>

  <p>“The Nine Schools Competition ends tomorrow.”</p>

  <p>“Not just the Nine Schools Competition! We will leave the country tomorrow! We will never again step foot into this country!”</p>

  <p>“Even if you leave, others will still come back, right?”</p>

  <p>“No Head Dragon will abandon Japan completely! Not just eastern Japan, but western Japan as well!”</p>

  <p>“Do you have the power to make such a promise, Douglas Huang?”</p>

  <p>The moment the opposing side called out his name, the man’s heart almost stopped from the blow. Even so, Huang desperately kept speaking.</p>

  <p>“I am the boss’s confidant! The boss can’t simply ignore my words!”</p>

  <p>“In what way?”</p>

  <p>“I once saved the boss’s life! You owe the man who saved you a favor, that is our custom!”</p>

  <p>“So you plan to use that ‘favor’ to bargain for your life.”</p>

  <p>Two looks shot towards Huang.</p>

  <p>They contained the hatred and killing intent reserved for traitors.</p>

  <p>However, Huang didn’t have the time to worry about that.</p>

  <p>“Didn’t you plan to use that favor to win back your life from your boss?”</p>

  <p>“No! The boss wouldn’t abandon me even if I didn’t do that!”</p>

  <p>“So you claim you have that much influence?”</p>

  <p>“Indeed!”</p>

  <p>“By what do you make this claim?”</p>

  <p>“That…”</p>

  <p>“No Head Dragon — the headless dragon. That name does not originate from your own organization, but was applied to you by other organizations because your leader never appears before the subordinates. Even those that require personal punishment are first rendered unconscious before being taken to a private room. Quite the thorough process indeed.”</p>

  <p>Huang was consumed by a fear that was altogether different from the terror that came from death or being disintegrated.</p>

  <p>He knew too much about his situation.</p>

  <p>Whose tail did he tread on this time.</p>

  <p>“Since you have so much influence, surely you must have seen the leader?”</p>

  <p>Regardless, he didn’t have time to contemplate this.</p>

  <p>In order to live, he must follow the path that this demon had pointed out to him.</p>

  <p>“I have been granted an audience.”</p>

  <p>“What is your leader’s name?”</p>

  <p>Huang shut his trap.</p>

  <p>That was the deepest secret within the organization.</p>

  <p>The terror and loyalty that have been engraved upon his soul through the passage of the years overrode the terror before his eyes.</p>

  <p>But only for a moment.</p>

  <p>“James!?”</p>

  <p>Another one of his companions disappeared from this earth.</p>

  <p>A destruction so complete that he wasn’t even permitted to die as a human being.</p>

  <p>This reminded him of the blasphemy that their leader used to execute the damned and sent a similar chill up his spine.</p>

  <p>“So that was James Zhu, eh. My apologies to the Interpol agents pursuing him across the globe.”</p>

  <p>“Wait…”</p>

  <p>“Is it your turn now, Douglas Huang?”</p>

  <p>“Please wait! …Our boss’s name is Richard Sun!”</p>

  <p>“And his public persona?”</p>

  <p>“…Sun Gongming.”</p>

  <p>“Address?”</p>

  <p>Hong Kong’s upper class residential sector, name of the office building, frequented nightclubs, Huang held nothing back.</p>

  <p>“…That is everything I know.”</p>

  <p>“And my questions come to a close. Thank you very much.”</p>

  <p>“Then, you believe me?”</p>

  <p>“Ah, you are undoubtedly one of No Head Dragon’s leader, Richard Sun’s confidants.”</p>

  <p>Brought to the brink of extermination, Huang’s entire body seemed to sag as his expression sang of his deliverance.</p>

  <p>This recently revived hope,</p>

  <p>“Gregori!”</p>

  <p>Was swiftly crushed with the annihilation of his last remaining comrade.</p>

  <p>“…Why!? We took no lives. We didn’t even kill anyone!”</p>

  <p class="separator"><img alt="chapter" src="../Images/separator.png" /></p>

  <p class="noindent">“…We didn’t even kill anyone!”</p>

  <p>A rather logical defense sprouted through the other side of the phone.</p>

  <p>But that was merely the result.</p>

  <p>They conspired to commit mass murder, but their plans were derailed by Yanagi, Sanada, and Fujibayashi.</p>

  <p>Yet Tatsuya didn’t point this out.</p>

  <p>“And why does that concern me?”</p>

  <p>“What…?”</p>

  <p>“How many you have slain or let live means nothing to me!”</p>

  <p>Tatsuya had reached the end of his tether in playing out this lifeless performance, so he was no longer disguising his voice.</p>

  <p>He had already obtained all the intel he wanted, so there was no need to play out this farce any longer.</p>

  <p>“You dared to touch that which cannot be touched.</p>

  <p>You dared to sully my scales.</p>

  <p>For that alone you all deserve to perish!”</p>

  <p>“…You demon!”</p>

  <p>“You are the ones to thank for unshackling the demon, Douglas Huang. Consciousness may be the force that propels strength, but emotions take that strength one step further.”</p>

  <p>Next to the speaker, Tatsuya lightly laughed at himself.</p>

  <p>His laughter mixed with the evening wind and accompanied the cold words of damnation that devoured all hope.</p>

  <p>“You have touched upon my last remaining emotion and thanks to you, I finally unleashed the ‘Power of the Demon’.”</p>

  <p>“You say the Power of the Demon…? This magic, it cannot be, Demon Right!?”</p>

  <p>That statement became Huang’s last words.</p>

  <p>Huang’s voice cut off from there.</p>

  <p>The entity that made up Douglas Huang was utterly extinguished from this world.</p>
