 <p>
  Part 1
 </p>
 <p>
  The rain was cold, light and thin.
 </p>
 <p>
  Long thin strands of rain fluttered amongst the parasol trees in the courtyard. The rain entangled parasol leaves and gloomy hearts alike.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth had reached the end of the long outer corridor, but he didn&rsquo;t walk out. He, too, was reluctant to get wet.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie walked up and stood behind him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth knew Liu Changjie was there, but he said nothing. Neither did Liu Changjie.
 </p>
 <p>
  They stood there quietly at the end of the corridor, watching the rain fall on the parasol trees in. They stood there for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Power of Hu really is cruel.&rdquo; Dragon Fifth let out a long sigh. &ldquo;He is not only cruel to others, he is cruel to himself.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Perhaps because he is at the end of his road,&rdquo; said Liu Changjie indifferently.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And because he is at the end of the road, you&rsquo;re going to let him go?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also a cruel person.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;No you&rsquo;re not.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie laughed, but it wasn&rsquo;t a happy laugh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth looked back at him. &ldquo;At the least, you will let him maintain his reputation.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Because his reputation wasn&rsquo;t stolen. He earned it through suffering and hard work.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I can see that.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have any personal animosity toward him. I don&rsquo;t want to see his reputation ruined.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not bringing him to justice. You&rsquo;re not making him return the things he stole.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t need to.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t need to?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;He is a very intelligent person. I don&rsquo;t need to make him. He should come to me himself to resolve the issue.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re waiting here for him to come.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And the case is still not closed.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth muttered to himself for a moment, then said, &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s willing to return the stolen property, willing to solve all the problems himself, then the case will be closed.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You should know why.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth turned his head and gazed at the distant, dark clouds. After a long time he quietly said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t let Qiu Hengbo go.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His face suddenly was filled with a very solemn look. &ldquo;No one can violate the law, or universal truths. Anyone who breaks the law must be punished.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth looked back and stared at him. &ldquo;Who are you, really? Why are you investigating this matter?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie didn&rsquo;t reply.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You obviously are not who you say you are,&rdquo; said Dragon Fifth. &ldquo;But you also don&rsquo;t want to sell yourself out.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie said nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Both Power of Hu and I investigated your background, yet neither of us found anything to indicate you were lying.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You really don&rsquo;t understand?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie laughed. &ldquo;When I encounter something I don&rsquo;t understand, I use a special method to deal with it.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;What method?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;When I don&rsquo;t understand something, I don&rsquo;t think about it. At least temporarily.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And afterwards?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Whatever the secret it is, it will be revealed eventually. You just have to wait patiently, and eventually you will figure it out.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth said nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe he couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about it, but he could stop asking.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rain fell in sheets, twilight grew deeper and deeper.
 </p>
 <p>
  Light footsteps could be heard.
 </p>
 <p>
  Then a hand was visible, carrying a lantern, walking slowly down the gloomy corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  The lamplight revealed a head of white hair, and the face of Power of Hu&rsquo;s faithful follower, the old doorman.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was expressionless.
 </p>
 <p>
  He had long ago mastered the ability to conceal sorrow within his heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;The two guests have not left yet?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man nodded his head. &ldquo;Of course the two guests aren&rsquo;t gone. However, the master is gone.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man stared at the curtains of falling rain. &ldquo;A storm may arise from a clear sky. People have mornings and evenings, disaster and happiness. I never thought that the master&rsquo;s sickness would flare up again so suddenly.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;He died of sickness?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man nodded his head. &ldquo;His rheumatism had long since seeped into his marrow. He&rsquo;s been a cripple for a long time, and to keep living down to this day hasn&rsquo;t been easy.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was completely expressionless, but within his eyes could be seen a strange expression. It was hard to say if he was grieving for Power of Hu, or begging Liu Changjie not to reveal his master&rsquo;s secret.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie looked at him, and finally nodded his head. &ldquo;Very well. So he died of sickness. I saw long ago that the disease was getting very serious.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  An expression of gratitude filled his eyes, and he sighed. &ldquo;Thank you. You really are a good person. The master did not misjudge you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Sighing again, he slowly turned and walked away down the corridor.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; asked Liu Changjie.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;To announce the master&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Where will you make the announcement?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;At Madam Autumn&rsquo;s.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was filled with resentment. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for her, the master&rsquo;s illness might not have been so bad. Now that the master is gone, I will definitely make sure she knows.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie&rsquo;s eyes shone. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me she will come here to pay her respects?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;She will come.&rdquo; He spoke one word at a time. &ldquo;She must come.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The rain outside the corridor grew thicker and thicker.
 </p>
 <p>
  The old man walked out of the corridor, and the lantern in his hand was instantly extinguished by the rain.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he didn&rsquo;t notice. Carrying the extinguished lantern, he slowly walked off into the darkness.
 </p>
 <p>
  Night had fallen, enveloping everything in blackness.
 </p>
 <p>
  After his crooked, emaciated frame disappeared into the night, Dragon Fifth let out a sigh. &ldquo;It seems you were correct. Power of Hu didn&rsquo;t disappoint.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie also sighed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Dragon Fifth said, &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t understand why Qiu Hengbo &lsquo;must&rsquo; come.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know either.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not going to think about it?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie laughed. &ldquo;Because I believe that in the end, all secrets will be revealed.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  He turned and stared at Dragon Fifth. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an expression I think you should never forget.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;What expression?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Heaven&rsquo;s net is wide meshed, nothing escapes it. The way of Heaven is fair, but the guilty will not escape.&rsquo;&rdquo; His eyes shone in the darkness. &ldquo;Whoever commits crimes, they should each and every one forget about escaping justice.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Part 2
 </p>
 <p>
  Dusk.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is dusk every day, but every dusk is different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Similarly, every person dies, and yet there are many types of death. Some people die bravely and with honor, others die in an ordinary and humble way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Power of Hu&rsquo;s death was neither ordinary nor humble.
 </p>
 <p>
  Many had come to his mourning hall to pay respects. Some were his disciples and friends, others merely came to because of his reputation. There was one person missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Madam Lovesickness had not arrived.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie wasn&rsquo;t anxious. He hadn&rsquo;t even asked about her.
 </p>
 <p>
  And he hadn&rsquo;t stopped Dragon Fifth from leaving. He&rsquo;d known all along that Dragon Fifth would leave, the same as he knew Qiu Hengbo would arrive.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth seeing her would only complicate matters.
 </p>
 <p>
  Qiu Hengbo would come, so Dragon Fifth had no choice but to leave.
 </p>
 <p>
  When seeing Dragon Fifth off, he&rsquo;d taken him to the end of the corridor and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll definitely come looking for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;When? When will you come?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie laughed. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s time to drink, of course.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth laughed. &ldquo;I always drink at Heavenly Fragrance.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  **
 </p>
 <p>
  The mourning hall had been set up in the spacious, ancient main hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie was nowhere to be seen, only the white-haired old servant, along with effigies of a virgin boy and a virgin girl, keeping vigil over the coffin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The night was deep.
 </p>
 <p>
  Eerie lamplight shone onto the exhausted face of the old servant. He himself looked like an effigy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mourning couplets, written on strips of white cloth, were hung all about, and there were piles of paper effigies of houses, horses, ships, and other lucky objects.
 </p>
 <p>
  These things had been gathered in preparation to be burned on the nights of &ldquo;Receiving the Third&rdquo; and &ldquo;Accompanying Night.&rdquo;&nbsp;
 </p>
 <p>
  The effigy of the horse cart was remarkably true to life. It had a man leading the horses, a man driving the cart, even extra helpers, horse tackle and whips. Their livery and their faces were all extremely lifelike. It was unfortunate that Power of Hu couldn&rsquo;t see them.
 </p>
 <p>
  The night wind was dull and desolate, the lamplight flickered, and then the shadow of a visitor floated into the room.
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor was wearing mourning clothes on top, and underneath, the dark clothes of someone who wishes to remain hidden at night.
 </p>
 <p>
  The old servant raised his head and glanced at him. The man knelt down, and the old servant knelt alongside. He kowtowed, and the old servant kowtowed with him.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a famous hero of the martial world like Power of Hu passes away, it&rsquo;s relatively common for unknown figures of the jianghu world to come in the dead of night to pay respects.
 </p>
 <p>
  It wasn&rsquo;t an unusual thing, and was nothing to be shocked about or to even ask questions about.
 </p>
 <p>
  And yet, this night visitor asked, &ldquo;Master Hu is really dead?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The old servant nodded his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;But the old man was fine just a few days ago. How could he suddenly pass away?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;A storm may arise from a clear sky,&rdquo; said the old servant gloomily. &ldquo;People have mornings and evenings, disaster and happiness. These matters, no one can predict.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;How did the old man pass?&rdquo; It seemed this passing visitor was very interested in Power of Hu&rsquo;s death.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;He died of sickness. He had a very serious disease.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor let out a long sigh. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see the old man for such a long time. I had no idea I would never see him again.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Sadly, you were just a bit too late.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Would it be possible for me to pay homage to his remains?&rdquo; It seemed this visitor couldn&rsquo;t let go of the idea of seeing Power of Hu.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The old servant&rsquo;s response was very direct. &ldquo;Others can. You can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor seemed shocked. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The old servant lowered his head. &ldquo;Because he didn&rsquo;t know you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor seemed more shocked. &ldquo;How do you know that he didn&rsquo;t know me?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t know you,&rdquo; replied the servant coldly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;So you know everyone he knew?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The old servant nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor also lowered his head. &ldquo;And if I&rsquo;m set on seeing him?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I know that you don&rsquo;t want to see him,&rdquo; was the cold response. &ldquo;The person who wants to see him is someone else.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor frowned. &ldquo;Do you know who does want to see him?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The old servant nodded again. With a cold laugh, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only confused about one thing.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Madam Autumn doesn&rsquo;t think the master is dead, so she wants to see his corpse. Why didn&rsquo;t she come herself, instead of sending a Five Gates thief like you to harass his spirit?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor&rsquo;s face changed. His hands flipped out to reveal a pair of poison-coated deerskin gloves.
 </p>
 <p>
  The old servant refused to look at him.
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor laughed. &ldquo;Even if I&rsquo;m just a Five Gates thief, I can still take your life.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  It seemed he really was ready to spring to action, but at that exact moment, a cold laugh could be heard. &ldquo;Shut your mouth and get out of here. Get the hell out!&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  **
 </p>
 <p>
  The voice was mesmerizing, as mesmerizing as if it had emanated from heaven.
 </p>
 <p>
  A third person could not be seen in the mourning hall, and it was impossible to tell where the voice came from.
 </p>
 <p>
  The old servant did not seem shocked at all. His face was completely expressionless. &ldquo;So you finally came,&rdquo; he said coldly. &ldquo;I knew you would come.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Part 3
 </p>
 <p>
  The visitor backed up step by step, until he was gone from the mourning hall.
 </p>
 <p>
  Left behind was only the white-haired, haggard old servant, illuminated by the desolate, eerie lamp.
 </p>
 <p>
  And then, the entire mourning hall was filled with a voice.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Justice of Hu.&rdquo; She was addressing the old servant by name. &ldquo;Since you knew I sent him here, why wouldn&rsquo;t you let him see the master&rsquo;s remains?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Justice of Hu&rsquo;s reply was just as clear-cut. &ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s not worthy.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And me? Am I worthy?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;The master predicted that you wouldn&rsquo;t believe he was really dead.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Therefore, he instructed me to wait for your arrival before sealing the coffin.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me he wants to see me one more time, too?&rdquo; She was laughing.
 </p>
 <p>
  Her laughter was both beautiful and sinister.
 </p>
 <p>
  As the laughter was ringing out, the paper effigies suddenly shattered into millions of pieces.&nbsp;
 </p>
 <p>
  Countless shreds of paper flitted about the mourning hall like colorful butterflies.
 </p>
 <p>
  And within the flying butterflies, a person floated down, looking like a beautiful white flower that had just bloomed.
 </p>
 <p>
  She wore a long, snow-white robe, and her face was covered with a white gauze veil. Her body looked like a white cloud that in an instant alighted in front of Justice of Hu.
 </p>
 <p>
  His face was still completely expressionless&mdash;he&rsquo;d known Madam Lovesickness would arrive.
 </p>
 <p>
  He&rsquo;d known long ago, and had been waiting for her for a long time.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Can I look at the master&rsquo;s remains now?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Of course you can,&rdquo; said Justice of Hu calmly. &ldquo;Who knows, perhaps the master really did want to see you one more time.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  **
 </p>
 <p>
  The coffin was not sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  Power of Hu lay quietly within, seeming more serene and peaceful than he had in life.
 </p>
 <p>
  Perhaps it was because he knew that no one in the world would ever again be able to force him to do things against his will.
 </p>
 <p>
  Madam Lovesickness finally let out a soft sigh. &ldquo;It seems he really is gone.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;It seems you&rsquo;re happy he went first.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Because I know that dead people can&rsquo;t take anything with them when they go.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s definitely not taking anything with him.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s not taking anything with him, then he should leave those things for me.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;What should be given to you has already been given.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Right here.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And why don&rsquo;t I see anything?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Because what you promised to bring to him, is not here.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Even if I brought it, he couldn&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I could see it.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t promise you. Hu Yue&rsquo;er isn&rsquo;t your daughter!&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Justice of Hu said nothing.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Where are the items?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Right here.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I still don&rsquo;t see anything.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Because I don&rsquo;t see Hu Yue&rsquo;er.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Madam Lovesickness laughed coldly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll never see her again.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Justice of Hu also laughed coldly. &ldquo;In that case, you&rsquo;ll never see the things you want.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;At the least, I can see one more thing.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;At the least,&rdquo; she said coldly, &ldquo;I can see your head fall to the ground.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Sadly, my head isn&rsquo;t worth even one coin.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Worthless things are sometimes very desirable.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;In that case, come get it whenever you want.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Madam Lovesickness laughed. &ldquo;You know very well that I&rsquo;m not going to kill you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;As long as you have at least one breath left, there&rsquo;s still a way for me to get you to tell the truth.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Her hand suddenly flicked out like an orchid.
 </p>
 <p>
  Justice of Hu didn&rsquo;t move.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another hand suddenly shot out like lightning to meet hers.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no third person in the hall, so where did the hand come from. Could it be that it came from within the coffin?
 </p>
 <p>
  The hand did not shoot out from the coffin.
 </p>
 <p>
  It was neither a dead hand, nor a hand made from paper.
 </p>
 <p>
  The effigies were already shattered into the countless shreds that still fluttered about like butterflies.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I was also waiting for your arrival.&rdquo; From within the fluttering butterflies appeared a smiling face.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie laughed.
 </p>
 <p>
  But within his laughter could be heard an unspeakable pain.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because, the energy of his palm strike had already lifted up Madam Lovesickness&rsquo;s gauze veil. He could finally lay eyes on her face.
 </p>
 <p>
  From the very beginning, he would never have been able to guess that this gloomy, mysterious woman, was actually Hu Yue&rsquo;er.
 </p>
 <p>
  Part 4
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth was wrapped up in a marten coat, reclining on the long, narrow couch. He stared at the deadwoods outside the window and muttered, &ldquo;How come it hasn&rsquo;t snowed at all this year?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  No one responded to him, and he didn&rsquo;t expect anyone to.
 </p>
 <p>
  Qin Huhua didn&rsquo;t speak very often.
 </p>
 <p>
  When a person begins to talk to oneself, it indicates that they are beginning to grow old.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth had heard this saying before, but forgot who said it.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me I really am growing old?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  He felt at the wrinkles in the corners of his eyes, and suddenly an indescribable feeling of loneliness welled up from his heart.
 </p>
 <p>
  Qin Huhua was warming wine for him.
 </p>
 <p>
  He seldom drank wine, but lately he had been drinking two cups every day.
 </p>
 <p>
  &mdash;When will you come?
 </p>
 <p>
  &mdash;When it&rsquo;s time to drink, of course.
 </p>
 <p>
  Suddenly, the light sound of footfalls could be heard from outside. A waiter appeared, wearing dark green clothes and a small cap. He carried a small platter, upon which was a soup bowl, covered.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth turned his head and suddenly laughed. &ldquo;Are there three hands in the soup bowl this time?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  **
 </p>
 <p>
  It was Liu Changjie.
 </p>
 <p>
  Smiling, he lifted the lid of the soup bowl and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one hand in here, a left hand.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Inside the soup bowl was the paw of a bear, which Dragon Fifth had ordered earlier, and had been slowly cooked for an entire day.
 </p>
 <p>
  The wine was warmed.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I knew you would come,&rdquo; laughed Dragon Fifth. &ldquo;You came just at the right time.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Qin Huhua had already filled two cups.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not drinking?&rdquo; Liu Changjie asked him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Qin Huhua shook his head.
 </p>
 <p>
  He glanced at Liu Changjie and then turned his head, his face expressionless.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie gazed at him and suddenly thought of the white-haired, haggard old servant, the man with a face like a dead tree, Justice of Hu.
 </p>
 <p>
  Every time he looked at Justice of Hu, he couldn&rsquo;t help but think of Qin Huhua.
 </p>
 <p>
  Could it be because they were the same type of person? Anyone who tried to guess their thoughts from the expressions on their faces, would never succeed.
 </p>
 <p>
  What was Liu Changjie thinking now?
 </p>
 <p>
  He was smiling, but the smile was dim, just like the overcast weather outside.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;This really is good weather for drinking.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth looked back at him, smiling. &ldquo;So I prepared a pot of wine, especially for you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie drank a cup. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s good wine.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  He sat down, and his smile brightened a bit. A cup of quality wine will always brighten the spirits.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth stared at him. &ldquo;You just arrived?&rdquo; he asked.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I thought you would arrive a few days ago.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I &hellip; I arrived late.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth laughed. &ldquo;Arriving late is better than not arriving at all.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie sat silently for a long time, thinking.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; he said suddenly. &ldquo;Sometimes not arriving at all is actually better.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  He obviously was not talking about himself.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Who are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Dragon Fifth.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie drank another cup. &ldquo;You should know who I&rsquo;m talking about.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;She really appeared?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You saw her?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And you recognized her?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me she really was Hu Yue&rsquo;er?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie downed his fifth cup. &ldquo;She obviously wasn&rsquo;t the real Hu Yue&rsquo;er.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never seen the real Hu Yue&rsquo;er, have you?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie nodded, and finished his sixth cup.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth continued, &ldquo;She abducted the real Hu Yue&rsquo;er and used her to blackmail Power of Hu, then impersonated her to meet with you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie downed the seventh cup. &ldquo;Do you want to know what happened to her in the end?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; He was smiling, but the smile was even more gloomy than the weather outside. &ldquo;I knew a long time ago what kind of person she is.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t know what happened to her in the end.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to know. A person&rsquo;s nature will dictate their end.&rdquo; He forced out a laugh. &ldquo;Heaven&rsquo;s net is wide meshed, nothing escapes it. The way of Heaven is fair, but the guilty will not escape. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten this.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie wanted to laugh, but couldn&rsquo;t. He had drunk all the wine in the jug.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth drank a cup. &ldquo;I never could figure out what kind of person that old man was.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You mean Justice of Hu?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth nodded. &ldquo;I actually suspected that he was the real Power of Hu.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Ah?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;In fact, I even suspected that they were the same person.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Did you ever hear the story of a person in the jianghu called &lsquo;the Ouyang Brothers?&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I have heard.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;The Ouyang brothers weren&rsquo;t actually two people. He was a man whose name was &lsquo;the Ouyang Brothers.&rsquo;&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;The Ouyang Brothers was actually one person. Couldn&rsquo;t it be possible that Power of Hu was actually two people?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie finally caught on.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Did you ever think of that possibility?&rdquo; asked Dragon Fifth.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Never. The relationship between two people can rarely be understood by a third party.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  He couldn&rsquo;t help but glance once more at Qin Huhua. What exactly was the relationship between him and Dragon Fifth? Was there something more than met the eye?
 </p>
 <p>
  He sighed. &ldquo;In any case, we will never know the answer to the mystery.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Because Justice of Hu also didn&rsquo;t leave the mourning hall alive.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Justice of Hu &ldquo;also&rdquo; was gone.
 </p>
 <p>
  Did the word &ldquo;also&rdquo; contain another meaning? Were there other people who &ldquo;also&rdquo; died in the mourning hall?
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth didn&rsquo;t ask.
 </p>
 <p>
  He didn&rsquo;t want to ask, and couldn&rsquo;t bear to ask.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;In any case, the case is finally closed,&rdquo; he said. He extended the wine jug, which had just been replenished, and refilled Liu Changjie&rsquo;s cup.
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie downed another. &ldquo;I never could have imagined that the case would be closed in this way.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;How did you think it would end? Did you really suspect me from the beginning?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie didn&rsquo;t answer his question. Instead, he said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re fundamentally a very suspicious person.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Because down to this very moment, I can&rsquo;t see through you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And what about you? Who can see through you?&rdquo; Dragon Fifth laughed. &ldquo;I always thought it was strange. Why could Power of Hu and all his people not learn the truth about you?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie laughed. &ldquo;Because there&rsquo;s no truth to learn.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth stared at him. One word at a time, he said, &ldquo;Can you finally tell me&hellip; Who are you?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You and Power of Hu both went to that little town,&rdquo; said Liu Changjie coolly. &ldquo;You both investigated me.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And we both found out nothing.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Of course you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He smiled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s because I was born in that little town, and I lived a very normal life.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;And now?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m just a local constable there.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  A look of shock covered Dragon Fifth&rsquo;s face.
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;A person like you, just a local constable from a small town?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie nodded. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t learn anything about my history because you never imagined that I really was just a small-town constable.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth let out a long sigh, and then laughed bitterly. &ldquo;I definitely never imagined.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You both only met me because my superiors ordered me to get involved with the case. Otherwise you would never have known that there was a person like me in the world.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;Are you telling the truth?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe me?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I believe you. But there&rsquo;s still something I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;A person like you, why would you choose to be a local constable?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always done whatever I feel like doing.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;You always wanted to be a constable?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  Liu Changjie nodded.
 </p>
 <p>
  Dragon Fifth laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Some people want to be famous heroes. Some people want to have a high position and a handsome salary. Some people seek fame and some people seek riches. I&rsquo;ve seen all these types of people before.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve never seen a person who wanted to be a constable?&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;There are definitely not very many people like you.&rdquo;
 </p>
 <p>
  &ldquo;There are plenty of famous heroes in the world, so there should definitely be some people like me, people who are willing to do that which other&rsquo;s won&rsquo;t do, or aren&rsquo;t willing to do.&rdquo; He smiled, and this time it was a happy smile. &ldquo;In the end, there have to be constables. And if a person can do what they want to do in life, shouldn&rsquo;t they be happy?&rdquo;&nbsp;
